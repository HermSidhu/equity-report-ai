92 Product overview 
Roshni lives in India, and loves her school. She is 12 years old and wants to become a doctor.
Roshni was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of four. The first few months were tough. It was hard to get the blood sugar levels 
right. Then she was referred to a hospital and enrolled in Novo Nordisk’s Changing Diabetes in Children programme, which offers free insulin, 
help on managing diabetes and support for her and her family.
The patient portrayed in this Annual Report have participated of her own accord and solely to express her personal opinions on topics 
referred to, which do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of Novo Nordisk. Use of her pictures as illustrations is in no way intended 
to associate them with the promotion of any Novo Nordisk products.

Letter from the Chair
Making good 
progress
Novo Nordisk made good progress during 2019. Our teams have 
delivered growth and crucial new product launches. This has 
 established a good platform for the next decade and beyond as we 
continue to build our pipeline and make progress as a sustainable 
business.
Our strategy is working. Although 
the challenges facing Novo Nordisk are 
not going away – indeed, many problems 
such as intensified competition, healthcare 
affordability and the need to bolster R&D 
are more urgent than ever – we have put 
in place the building-blocks for responding 
to these and other challenges. The Board 
of Directors is confident that Novo Nordisk 
is well positioned to deliver on its purpose 
of defeating diabetes and other serious 
chronic diseases and, by doing so, achieve 
profitable growth.
Last year, we laid out our plans to repriori-
tise resources towards key growth areas, 
streamline operations and redefine our 
research and development strategy. I am 
pleased to say that these changes are now 
bearing fruit, as evidenced by an accelera-
tion of sales in International Operations, a 
return to growth in our Biopharm business, 
and a reinvigorated pipeline with great 
potential to offer treatment for unmet 
medical needs.
We recognise that relying solely on in-house 
research capabilities will not be enough to 
sustain success, and we are therefore open-
ing our business to strategic partnerships. 
Novo Nordisk’s market strength and deep 
expertise in metabolic diseases makes the 
company an attractive partner for innova-
tive biotech companies. This has allowed 
us to build partnerships to bring on-board 
promising new technologies.
As a large company, Novo Nordisk also 
has large responsibilities. Society is 
 expecting more from business to help solve 
 challenges such as bending the curve on 
 diabetes, climate change and environmen-
tal degradation. I believe Novo Nordisk, 
with its purpose and commitment to 
pursuing a more sustainable development, 
is well placed to rise to the challenge.
The pharmaceutical industry faces an 
important societal challenge: how can 
we continue to innovate and improve 
health outcomes while at the same time 
ensuring that as many people as possible 
have access to our products at an afford-
able price? This issue has been discussed 
at every board meeting I have chaired. I 
believe our initiatives for enhancing access 
to care represent real progress towards re-
solving this dilemma. And so do the major 
prevention programmes targeting obesity 
and diabetes.
The decisions taken by companies like ours 
will help shape the future of societies for 
generations to come, whether that means 
bending the curve of the global diabetes 
epidemic or eliminating our environmental 
footprint, another area of priority for Novo 
Nordisk.
Over the past year, I have visited our offices 
in many parts of the world. I have met 
people on the front line of operations who 
have told me how working for a company 
committed to improving healthcare and 
promoting sustainability motivates them.
The insights from these meetings, and the 
discussions I have had with patients and 
our investors, have brought external per-
spectives into the boardroom. The lesson 
I take away is simple: purpose comes first, 
profit is an outcome. A clear purpose and 
ambition to add value to society beyond 
financial results helps attract the top talent, 
thereby fuelling innovation and making 
Novo Nordisk a more sustainable company.
In the course of 2019, two long-tenured 
colleagues, Jesper Brandgaard, executive 
vice president of Biopharm & Global Legal 
& Patents, and Lars Green, executive vice 
president of Business Services & Compli-
ance, both left Novo Nordisk to pursue 
their careers elsewhere. I want to thank 
them both for the legacy they leave and 
commend them for their dedication and 
leadership and for the achievements they 
made on behalf of Novo Nordisk.
New members were brought on board 
from outside of Novo Nordisk. Ludovic 
Helfgott joined in April 2019 as executive 
vice president and head of Biopharm. 
 Monique Carter, who joined Novo Nordisk 
in November 2018, was promoted in 
August 2019 to executive vice president of 
People & Organisation.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
 offer my thanks to all Novo Nordisk’s 
employees for their hard work and commit-
ment during 2019; to Lars Fruergaard 
Jørgensen and his team for their inspiring 
leadership and to our shareholders for their 
continued support. •

Letter from the CEO
Setting new 
strategic 
aspirations
Our purpose is to drive change to defeat diabetes and other  serious 
chronic diseases. That is a long-term commitment, and we are 
pursuing it relentlessly. We build on our innovation expertise and 
our therapy focus combined with commercial excellence to provide 
benefits to the millions of patients who rely on our products. When 
we do that well, we will be a sustainable business that adds value 
to society and delivers profitable growth.
As we enter a new decade, Novo 
Nordisk stands strong. We delivered a very 
solid financial result for 2019 reflecting 
an accelerated growth in International 
 Operations and the contribution from the 
launch of Ozempic
®
 particularly in North 
America Operations.
Three milestones stand out: in the US, we 
secured a major scientific achievement 
with the regulatory approval of Rybelsus
®
, 
the world’s first and only GLP-1 medicine 
in a tablet, and early feedback indicates 
 promising prospects. In January 2020, 
 Ozempic
®
, a once-weekly injectable GLP-1, 
was approved in the US for  cardiovascular 
risk reduction in people with type 2 
 diabetes and established cardiovascular 
disease. Ozempic
®
 is now available in 26 
countries and achieved blockbuster status 
within 18 months. 
We have introduced strategic aspirations 
in four categories with medium-term 
goals to provide direction towards 2025: 
purpose and sustainability; innovation and 
therapeutic focus; commercial execution; 
and financials. I invite you to also look 
at our company’s performance from this 
holistic perspective, because that is how 
we  manage the business. These aspirations 
replace our long-term financial targets. We 
hold ourselves accountable for progress 
towards each and all of them, and in the 
following pages we elaborate on the new 
aspirations.
Our key contribution is to discover and de-
velop innovative biological medicines and 
make them accessible to patients all over 
the world. Today, we have best-in-class 
products in all the therapy areas in which 
we are active, and at the end of 2019 our 
sales and marketing teams have delivered 
no fewer than 87 successful launches, 
delivering innovative treatments to people 
living with diabetes, obesity,  haemophilia 
and growth hormone disorders. We 
are accelerating growth in International 
Operations where we now aspire to grow 
annual sales by 6-10% until 2025 from a 
historical level of 5-6%. Meanwhile, we 
are transforming our US business, and it 
is our ambition that by 2022 around 70% 
of our sales will come from new products. 
It is also encouraging to note that our 
Biopharm business has proven robust in 
the face of disruptive competition and has 
grown in both the haemophilia and growth 
hormone disorder product segments.
One of the greatest opportunities for Novo 
Nordisk is undoubtedly obesity care, where 
there are huge unmet needs. We have 
already established a leading position in 
this field and expect to build on the success 
of Saxenda
®
, which is now available in 46 
countries. In 2020 we will see the results 
of our pivotal clinical programme, STEP, 
which evaluates the benefits of injectable 
 semaglutide for the treatment of obesity.
Our contribution to global health relies 
on our ability to develop radically new 
treatments and solutions and we are well 
positioned to do this. We have raised the 
innovation-bar and are bolstering our 
 pipeline, making significant advances in 
R&D productivity by harnessing digital tech-
nologies to accelerate development of new 
product candidates. We believe we have 
what it takes to potentially even disrupt 
how diabetes is treated. To complement 
our in-house capabilities to develop novel 
therapies we partner with leading biotech 
companies like bluebird bio and Dicerna.
All of these accomplishments demonstrate 
how we are indeed driving change to 
benefit patients and delivering convincing 
results. Results that are

reflected in strong financial performance 
and achievement of our long-term financial 
targets.
But in a world where serious chronic 
 diseases not only have a significant impact 
on individuals’ quality of life, but also ham-
per socio-economic development and put a 
strain on healthcare budgets, it takes more 
than medicines. We consider it our respon-
sibility to help tackle these challenges. That 
is what we mean by driving change.
We are stepping up our efforts to ensure 
broader access to our medicines for those 
who need them, regardless of their circum-
stances. Ensuring affordability of medicines 
is a high priority for us, and we have 
 expanded our affordable insulin offerings in 
the US, where our offerings provide a solid 
safety net for uninsured patients, and in 
low- and middle-income countries, where 
healthcare systems are inadequate.
We are working with partners across 
the globe to advance disease prevention 
through education and on-the-ground 
 interventions. Our Cities Changing 
 Diabetes programme now involves 25 
cities. In 2019, we entered a partnership 
with UNICEF to develop interventions that 
can help prevent childhood overweight and 
obesity worldwide, with an initial focus 
on Latin America and the Caribbean. And 
through our partnership with the Interna-
tional Red Cross, we are providing essential 
insulin to thousands of people who are 
affected by humanitarian crises.
During 2019, we launched an ambitious 
new environmental strategy, Circular 
for Zero, which will take us towards our 
ultimate ambition, namely to ensure zero 
environmental impact from our activities. 
As of this year, our entire global production 
sources renewable power and the next 
major milestone in sight is to eliminate CO
2
 
entirely from all operations and transport 
by 2030.
With the Novo Nordisk Way as our guide, 
we will continue to evolve our culture. To 
be successful we must set ambitious goals, 
and we must work in a simple and agile 
way and nurture an inclusive workplace 
that enables everyone to realise their 
potential.
We aim to be a truly sustainable business 
– environmentally, socially and financially. 
From the very beginning, this is how we 
have built our business, sticking with the 
Novo Nordisk Way. I am confident that we 
have a solid formula for delivering on our 
purpose, contributing to global sustainable 
development and sustaining commercial 
success. Let me close by thanking everyone 
at Novo Nordisk for all their great work and 
their commitment to our shared purpose. 
A special thanks to our Board of Directors 
for their decisive stewardship, constructive 
challenges and unwavering confidence. I 
also want to thank our shareholders and all 
our other stakeholders for their continued 
support. •

Purpose and sustainability:
Leading a 
sustainable 
business
Our business is built on a commitment to drive change to defeat 
diabetes and other serious chronic diseases. We do so by pioneer-
ing scientific breakthroughs and expanding access to our medi-
cines. But we do not stop at that. We are also working to prevent, 
and ultimately cure, these diseases. We have a legacy in diabetes 
of almost a century, and over the years we have expanded into 
other serious chronic diseases.
In 2019, we entered a partnership with 
UNICEF to develop interventions that can 
help prevent childhood overweight and 
obesity worldwide, with an initial focus on 
Latin America and the Caribbean. Through 
this partnership we will combine efforts to 
enhance knowledge and awareness and 
address root causes. The aim is three-fold. 
We want to enhance knowledge among 
decision-makers on successful policies to 
prevent childhood overweight and obesity 
in middle-income countries. We will build 
awareness of the impact of overweight and 
obesity on children and their rights and 
advocate for the need to make systemic 
changes to address this growing epidemic. 
And finally, we will drive and strengthen 
multi-sector interventions.
With the right medical treatment and care, 
people with serious chronic diseases can 
live a life free of complications and be fully 
productive citizens. But as long as there is a 
significant gap between those who achieve 
good health and those who do not, the sit-
uation is unsustainable and will impact our 
ability to be successful for the long-term.
We are stepping up our efforts to provide 
broader access to our medicines for those 
who need them. We will actively be part 
of ensuring that more people are given 
access to diagnosis and that Novo Nordisk 
medicines are available and affordable, 
and we will continue to develop new and 
innovative treatments to further improve 
health outcomes for patients. Meanwhile, 
we will also support prevention by building 
capacity in health systems and societies. 
When we succeed at all this, it will ulti-
mately lead to better health and thereby 
help contain the vast societal and financial 
burden arising from chronic diseases.

There will not be resources to provide 
for adequate chronic care for all who 
need it. In the public debate strong voices 
are questioning our business model and 
current practices for intellectual property 
rights, putting pressure on the price of es-
sential medicines, and expecting us to take 
more responsibility for solving the problems 
caused by the pandemic growth of chronic 
diseases as well as other global issues. We 
want to be part of the solution, and we are 
stepping up to that challenge. 
We envisage a future in which markets and 
governments will punish companies that 
are seen to cause harm to people, com-
munities or the environment through their 
products or operations, and reward those 
that account transparently for their impacts 
and benefit society. Our aspiration is to be 
respected for adding value to society.
We take leadership in the concerted efforts 
to achieve good health and well being 
for all. We have also committed to take 
action in the face of climate change, with a 
bold ambition to leave zero environmental 
footprint from our business activities. Our 
strategy is informed by the global goals 
for sustainable development towards 2030 
set by world leaders in 2015. We can help 
deliver on these goals. 
Preventing the rise in diabetes and 
obesity
In a world strained by the impact of dia-
betes, we have a responsibility to respond 
to the societal challenge. The burden of 
diabetes, fuelled by increasing rates of 
overweight and obesity, is rising in every 
part of the world despite long-running, col-
lective efforts to fight the pandemic and its 
devastating impact on people and societies. 
To defeat diabetes, we need a new level of 
commitment. Prevention of diabetes and 
obesity is systematically underfunded and 
there are few, if any effective models that 
adequately address inequality in health. We 
want to find, pilot and scale effective ways 
to prevent people at risk from developing 
diabetes and obesity.
In support of the Sustainable Development 
Goals, we are working with partners across 
the globe to advance disease prevention 
through education and on-the-ground in-
terventions. Our Cities Changing Diabetes 
programme has become a social movement 
in its own right, mobilising multiple stake-
holders in the effort to tackle the growing 
issues of urban diabetes and build healthier 
environments. By now we have 25 partner 
cities.

Introducing Novo NordiskOur business
health systems. As a global healthcare 
company, we know that different ap-
proaches are needed to ensure that the 
most vulnerable people receive the care 
they need. For this reason, Novo Nordisk 
has put in place a number of initiatives 
aimed at ensuring that vulnerable groups 
have access to affordable medicines and 
care, including:
•   Through our Access to Insulin Commit-
ment we have set a ceiling price of USD 4 
for a 10 ml vial of Human Insulin offered 
to governments in low- and middle- 
income countries and to humanitarian 
organisations.
•   Through the Changing Diabetes
®
 in 
Children programme we provide insulin 
free of charge to children with type 
1 diabetes and build capacity in the 
world’s poorest countries. In 2019, we 
enrolled 2,819 additional children. In to-
tal 15,121 health care professionals have 
been trained, 208 clinics established and 
25,695 children across 14 countries have 
received care as part of the programme 
since 2009.
•   We work to strengthen capacity to 
diagnose and treat people affected by 
humanitarian crises through Partnering 
for Change with the International Com-
mittee of the Red Cross and the Danish 
Red Cross. 
•   Through the World Diabetes Founda-
tion, we support large-scale diabetes 
capacity building in low-resource 
settings and through the Defeat NCD 
partnership we support a new multi- 
sector effort to improve global access to 
care for non-communicable diseases.
In September 2019, the United Nations 
adopted the Political Declaration on Uni-
versal Health Coverage in support of the 
Sustainable Development Goals. In Novo 
Nordisk we welcome this effort to find sus-
tainable solutions and we will continue to 
expand our own efforts to provide access 
to our products and strengthen capacity 
to diagnose and treat diabetes throughout 
the world.
Affordable insulin in the US
Ensuring affordability of medicines within 
the complex US healthcare system contin-
ues to be a high priority. This year, we met 
face-to-face with some of our most vocal 
critics in the insulin pricing debate – includ-
ing patients and physicians – to improve 
our understanding of the affordability 
challenges that patients are facing. And we 
are continuing to launch initiatives to help 
more people with diabetes access afford-
able medicine – including those with insur-
ance and those without – as we continue 
to support a longer-term, systemic reform. 
New insulin affordability offers, effective as 
of January 2020, include:
•    A Cash Card Program, offering that for 
USD 99, people with diabetes can get up 
to three vials or two packs of FlexPen
®
/
FlexTouch
®
/PenFill
®
 pens of any combi-
nation of Novo Nordisk Inc. insulins.
•    NovoLog
®
 and NovoLog
®
 Mix follow-on 
brands are made available in vials and 
pens at a 50 percent list price reduc-
tion from the newly established Novo 
 Nordisk Pharma Inc.
•   An immediate, one-time insulin supply 
option available for people facing an 
acute need when more time is needed 
to identify a sustainable solution.
These new options build upon our existing 
offers:
•   The Patient Assistance Program, which 
we have offered since 2003. This pro-
vides free medicines, including all Novo 
Nordisk insulin medications, to eligible 
patients. Families of four with an annual 
income up to USD 103,000 can get 
free medications through our Patient 
Assistance Program (USD 49,960 for 
individuals).
•   We have made Novo Nordisk human 
insulin available at Walmart for about 
USD 25/vial for the past 15 years, and 
recently expanded it to other national 
pharmacy chains.
•   Our Co-pay Savings Cards help spread 
the costs of commercially insured pa-
tients with high out-of-pocket costs.
Pursuing zero environmental impact
Our long-standing climate action efforts 
are paying off. We expect to meet our 
target of using only renewable power in 
our production by 2020. The final stretch 
was the result of a new investment in a 2.7 
square kilometre solar panel installation 
in North Carolina, USA, which will make 
 power supplies for our entire US produc-
tion carbon-free from early 2020.
Our next ambitious target is to achieve 
zero CO
2
 emissions from all operations and 
transport by 2030. This target is part of our 
‘Circular for Zero’ environmental strategy, 
which ultimately aims for zero environmen-
tal impact from our business. We focus on 
three key areas:
•   Circular supply: we will collaborate 
proactively with suppliers to embed 
circular thinking for reduced environ-
mental impact across our value chain 
and switch towards circular sourcing and 
 procurement. 
•   Circular company: we aim to eliminate 
environmental footprint from Novo 
Nordisk operations and drive a circular 
transition across the company aspiring 
for zero environmental impact.
•   Circular products: we will upgrade 
existing and design new products based 
on circular principles and solve the end-
of-life product waste challenge to close 
the resource loop.
Sustainable business approach
As a business with global reach, we are 
defining our role in contributing to an 
environment, society and economy that 
enables all people, and our business, to 
thrive. Our ambition is to be a sustainable 
business that adds value to society. By that 
we mean staying in business –  because 
millions of people rely on us – and con-
tributing to the achievement of global 
sustainable development. 
In our approach, we adhere to interna-
tional standards, including the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
voluntary commitments such as the UN 
Global Compact Ten Principles and the 
recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures. We 
also diligently adhere to compliance re-
quirements such as the US Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and the 
UK Modern Slavery Act.
And throughout, we seek to integrate 
sustainability in all our operations. For 
example, environmental considerations are 
included in the project manual for develop-
ment of new products, ensuring that deci-
sions are informed by life cycle assessments 
of environmental impacts.
So how will we know when we are doing 
enough – throughout our value chain?  We 
are changing the way we manage, track 
and report on progress to be a sustainable 
business. Taking our point of departure in 
what science and international standards 
have defined to be necessary in a global 
context, we follow a robust approach to 
identify current state and required actions 
through a focused, long-term effort.

Guided by the Novo Nordisk Way
We build our business on a principled 
approach to always doing business in a 
financially, environmentally and socially 
responsible way, which is firmly anchored 
in the Articles of Association. This commit-
ment is reflected in the Novo Nordisk Way, 
and guides how we lead a sustainable busi-
ness. When we make decisions, we always 
keep in mind what is best in the long term 
for the patients we serve, our employees, 
the communities in which we are present 
and the global society we are part of. This 
way we seek to attend to the interests 
of stakeholders as well as the long-term 
interests of our shareholders. The goal is to 
avoid any negative impacts, and maximise 
the positive impacts we can make through 
our business activities. 
We use a unique and systematic approach 
called facilitation to make sure  everyone 
lives up to the Novo Nordisk Way. It 
comprehensively assesses how managers 
and employees demonstrate our desired 
behaviours, our ten ‘Essentials‘. These 
assessments are conducted by experienced 
in-house experts with a broad knowledge 
of the business. Any issues are addressed 
locally, and consolidated insights are shared 
with Executive Management and the Board 
of Directors.
The Novo Nordisk Way also underpins our 
performance management and incentive 
schemes. All employees are appraised 
against criteria for goal achievement as 
well as the extent to which their behaviours 
model the Novo Nordisk Way, as spelled 
out in the Essentials.
We have global codes of conduct and 
standards to ensure that we conduct our 
business ethically and responsibly: to pre-
vent corruption, meet our responsibility to 
respect human rights, safeguard health and 
fair employment terms for our employees 
as well as those of our suppliers, effective-
ly manage and mitigate impacts on the 
environment and respect the integrity of 
our business partners. These practices are 
put into action via robust governance and 
assurance, in adherence with international 
standards.
Evolving our culture
Novo Nordisk core capabilities provide a 
competitive advantage. Building on a deep 
disease understanding, we are a leader 
in chronic disease care. We have deep 
expertise in engineering, formulating, 
developing and delivering protein-based 
treatments. And we have the capacity for 
efficient large-scale production.
To meet the needs of the patients we serve, 
we are continuously challenging ourselves 
to raise the innovation-bar while pursuing 
aspirational goals. That, in turn, demands 
that we change how we work – that we 
evolve our culture – to think bigger, strive 
for simplicity and be more agile in order 
to quickly adapt to a constantly-changing 
business environment.
With bold ideas, the risk of failure will 
increase. We have to accept failure, and 
learn fast from them. We find inspiration 
from the agility and entrepreneurial mind-
set in biotech start-ups. One example is the 
Novo Nordisk Research Centre in Seattle, 
USA, where we work with cutting-edge 
technologies in life sciences. It was initially 
set up in 2009 to focus on our now discon-
tinued research in autoimmune diseases. 
Since then, the site has transitioned into 
type 1 diabetes, obesity, immunology, 
kidney disease, device research and protein 
and peptide engineering. Here, a diverse 
group of 120 employees are encouraged 
to work together across functions and in 
close collaboration with the global R&D 
organisations across Novo Nordisk and 40 
strategic partners.
The landmark development of Rybelsus
®
, 
the first ever oral GLP-1 product, is a 
stellar example of simplicity and agility. The 
submission for marketing approval of Ry-
belsus
®
 embodies the FAST concept, intro-
duced in 2019 across R&D: Flexible, Agile, 
Simple and Transformational. The team 
ensured parallel rather than sequential pro-
cesses without compromising on quality, 
following a clinical development program 
involving more than 9,500 patients, 10 
phase 3a studies, and more than 20 clinical 
pharmacology studies. As a result, timelines 
were reduced to way below industry stan-
dards, achieving approval within six months 
and bringing Rybelsus
®
 faster to the market 
to the benefit of patients.
Our four Transformational Research Units, 
which pursue novel treatment forms and 
platform technologies, illustrate this type 
of cultural evolution. These biotech-like 
units, based in Denmark, the USA and the 
UK, operate as satellites to Novo Nordisk’s 
central R&D function and drive innovation 
in prioritised fields such as translational 
cardio-metabolic research and stem cell 
research. Working in a highly agile manner, 
outside of the usual governance structures, 
they are largely free of most corporate 
formalities and control – so they can dis-
cover, enable and accelerate concepts and 
projects that will expand and diversify our 
pipeline with disruptive medicines. •

Chronic diseases affect hundreds 
of millions of people and are among the 
most urgent global health challenges. Left 
untreated, they can lead to life-threatening

part in ensuring that more people have ac-
cess to diagnosis and affordable treatment 
options where they do not currently exist, 
and we continue to drive innovation in our 
labs that can improve life for people living 
with a serious chronic disease.
Our innovation and therapeutic focus is 
leveraged by our commercial excellence. 
We draw upon insights from patients 
and partners to transform bold ideas into 
life-saving and preventive medicines. We 
make long-term investments in novel treat-
ments and technologies, including curative 
stem cell-based therapies, and we contin-

important to Novo Nordisk, and it remains 
the only treatment for type 1 diabetes. We 
are relentlessly pursuing a cure for type 
1 diabetes, and at the same time we are 
working to develop stem cell therapy that 
could be transformational.
 
We will strengthen our leading position 
within insulin and gain market share with 
our current portfolio of next-generation 
insulin products. Meanwhile, in our inno-
vation pipeline we continue to focus on 
delivering improved glucose control, but 
we also target diabetes-related complica-
tions. We are researching glucose sensitive 
insulins and cardio-protective insulins.
With our two recent GLP-1 products, 
Ozempic
®
 and Rybelsus
®
, we want to 
redefine type 2 diabetes treatment. Our 
intention is to position Rybelsus
®
 as the 
preferred tablet, and Ozempic
®
 as the pre-
ferred injectable GLP-1 for the treatment of 
type 2 diabetes.
We are at the forefront of innovation in the 
GLP-1 class and orally administered delivery 
devices and are pursuing several therapeu-
tic opportunities with semaglutide. 
Our digital health initiatives, which include 
connected devices and digital solutions, 
also aim to improve health outcomes for 
patients. Not only will these tools aim to 
make it easier for patients to manage their 
treatment and bring them in better control; 
this will potentially allow for data capture 
that can document adherence patterns as 
well as short and long-term benefits of our 
treatments.

 Obesity  care
Around 650 million adults live with obesi-
ty
13
 and this number is expected to grow 
to more than one billion by 2025.
14
 In ad-
dition, 120 million children have obesity.
15
 
People with obesity are at an increased risk 
of developing several comorbidities that are 
life-threatening and costly for society. From 
a socioeconomic perspective, obesity is one 
of the biggest disease burdens, with its 
global economic impact estimated at USD 
2 trillion annually.
16
Still, obesity is not widely recognised as a 
disease that may require medical treat-
ment. Today, around 15 million people use 
anti-obesity medication.
18
 Few medications 
exist, leaving a significant opportunity for 
Novo Nordisk as a market leader for anti- 
obesity medication. We aim to develop a 
leading portfolio of treatment solutions. 
We are committed to expanding access 
to obesity care and helping patients lead 
healthy lives. The first step is to change 
how the world sees people with obesity 
and make obesity a healthcare priority. We 
are determined to combat the stigma and 
biases associated with obesity. We fight for 
better recognition of obesity as a treatable 
disease, taking a holistic approach. We 
aim to help a wider number of people, by 
partnering with professional associations 
and other stakeholders. In this effort, we 
need to engage with payers and  educate 
healthcare professionals, encourage people 
with obesity to seek treatment, and de-
velop educational programmes and open 
research initiatives. 
We support this development with preven-
tive interventions, commercial execution 
and pipeline research progress – developing 
a leading portfolio of superior treatment 
solutions and securing broad availability of 
treatments for people with obesity. Sax-
enda
®
, currently available in 46 countries, 
addresses a global unmet need for medical 
weight management. Over the next few 
years, we will make Saxenda
®
 available to 
more people in more countries.
We are working to develop new anti-obe-
sity medications based on semaglutide. 
We are awaiting the results of our pivotal 
phase 3a clinical development programme, 
STEP, which investigates injectable 
semaglutide for the treatment of obesity. 
Meanwhile, we are gathering evidence 
on how obesity management can lead to 
sustainable and relevant health, economic 
and societal outcomes.
Secure a leading position in Biopharm
Our Biopharm business is a strong speciality 
care unit that encompasses rare blood and 
rare endocrine disorders, both areas of 
significant unmet medical need.
While Biopharm’s performance has been 
resilient and robust the future is not 
straightforward, due to intense competi-
tion and slower growth in the haemophilia 
and growth hormone markets. Therefore, 
we are expanding our focus to shape 
Biopharm for leadership in rare blood 
 disorders and rare endocrine disorders.
In the near term the way we will be suc-
cessful is by working towards

developing and delivering faster and more 
front-loaded launches, in more markets. 
Additionally, we will strengthen our Bio-
pharm platform by reinvigorating our R&D 
efforts and utilising the full range of the 
technology platforms at our disposal, as 
well as pursuing external opportunties.
Within rare blood disorders, we are 
well-positioned with a broad product port-
folio in haemophilia. Our legacy recombi-
nant product, NovoSeven
®
, remains resilient 
in a competitive market, and with our 
latest, long-acting products, Esperoct
®
 and 
Refixia
®
, we are expanding our offering for 
patients with Haemophilia A, Haemophilia 
B and rare bleeding disorders. In 2019, we 
launched Esperoct
® 
and are accelerating 
our launches to new markets so that many 
more patients can benefit from this extend-
ed half-life factor VIII therapy. We also 
succeeded in including the use of automat-
ed infusion pumps in the European label for 
NovoSeven
®
, a testimony to the strong life 
cycle management of our legacy products.
We will accelerate innovation by leveraging 
all Novo Nordisk R&D technology  platforms 
– using the full spectrum from stem cell 
research to formulation and encapsula-
tion – to expand our pipeline. In 2019, 
we initiated phase 3 clinical trials with 
concizumab for Haemophilia A and B with 
and without inhibitors. We are also about 
to begin phase 1 clinical trials with our 
next-generation recombinant factor VIII, 
Mim8, a bispecific antibody for subcutane-
ous prophylactic treatment in people with 
haemophilia A. Outside of haemophilia we 
are conducting phase 1 trials with EPI01 in 
sickle cell disease.
We will look for external assets as well. 
By joining forces with bluebird bio in 
next-generation genome editing, we aim 
to offer a potentially curative treatment for 
children and adults with haemophilia A.
Within rare endocrine disorders, we will 
maintain our leading position in the growth 
hormone segment by offering transforma-
tive treatment options. We will continue 
to explore innovation through all Novo 
Nordisk R&D platforms. We will build on 
the market-leading quality of our  devices, 
support increased rates of diagnosis, 
and continue to work towards bringing 
somapacitan, our next-generation product 
intended for once-weekly treatment, to 
market to treat growth hormone disorders. 
Shifting the treatment paradigm from a 
daily to a weekly injection has the poten-
tial to significantly relieve the treatment 
burden for people with growth hormone 
deficiencies and may increase adherence 
and efficacy.
Establish presence in other serious 
chronic diseases 
Finally, we are working to establish our 
presence in other serious chronic diseases 
such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and 
chronic kidney disease (CKD).
NASH is a progressed stage of non- 
alcoholic fatty liver disease that affects 
an estimated 30 million people in the US, 
Europe and Japan and for which there 
are no approved treatments. NASH is a 
common comorbidity of diabetes and 
obesity; 80% of diagnosed NASH patients 
live with obesity
19
, while 35% live with 
type 2 diabetes.
20
 We are still exploring the 
potential of semaglutide to offer people 
with NASH better control over their disease 
as a stand-alone therapy and as a combi-
nation product together with our partner, 
Gilead, a global pharmaceutical company 
specialising in liver diseases.
We are also exploring therapies for treat-
ment of cardiovascular diseases. Some of 
our GLP-1 products reduce the risk of car-
diovascular disease and are also currently 
recommended for the treatment of type 
2 diabetes for established cardiovascular 
disease. Oral semaglutide is being further 
investigated in cardiovascular outcomes 
trials and more early-stage projects are in 
the pipeline.
Multiple other serious chronic diseases 
represent vast unmet medical needs that 
are waiting to be defeated. We believe we 
can use our innovation capabilities to meet 
these. We will build a competitive pipeline 
and leverage our scientific leadership to 
broaden and widen our portfolio as we 
expand into adjacent disease areas. As 
in other therapy areas, we will nurture 
partnerships and relationships across 
our field force and R&D with healthcare 
professionals and other stakeholders. New 
technologies, including stem cell-based 
therapies, will help this expansion into 
new therapeutic areas such as Parkinson’s 
disease, dry age-related macular degenera-
tion, and chronic heart failure. Forming the 
right strategic alliances and transforming 
the way we deliver innovation will help us 
achieve our aspirations in this area. •

1. Based on 2019 sales
Strategic aspirations for 2025
Commercial 
execution
Our International Operations (IO) unit covers 190 countries and 
95% of the world’s population. Around 430 million people are liv-
ing with diabetes in these countries
21
 and an estimated 570 million 
live with obesity.
22
 The unmet needs are huge, and Novo Nordisk is 
gearing up for growth, with a strategic aspiration of 6-10% annual 
growth in sales towards 2025.
Across IO, the number of people with 
diabetes is rising fast. As economies grow, 
so too does the level of access to different 
types of diabetes treatment. In a business 
unit as broad as IO, this creates a high 
degree of complexity due to different levels 
of security, economic development and 
political situation in the respective regions.
The fastest increase in type 2 diabetes is 
seen in emerging economies, where rapid 
urbanisation leads to more sedentary 
lifestyles and less healthy diets. Type 2 dia-
betes in younger people is also a significant 
global trend that will increasingly affect the 
way we operate commercially. 
With type 2 diabetes so closely linked to 
obesity, these trends are also informing our 
obesity strategy. As the number of younger 
people with obesity grows, so does the 
number of instances of diabetes in people 
in their 30s and 40s. At this age, these are 
primarily working people, which means 
that doctors need to give them different 
guidance to what they might tell a retiree.
A market fit approach
To ensure as many as possible of these 
people can access our treatments, we tailor 
our strategic approach to the specific needs 
of each market. We have a diverse port-
folio of products that enables us to have 
suitable offers for all situations – we call 
that our market fit approach. For example, 
our range of basal insulin includes human 
insulin, modern insulin and next-generation 
insulin – providing us with a solid base 
as a leader in diabetes care. At the same 
time, we also offer GLP-1 products that we 
expect will drive future growth in Diabetes 
and Obesity care.
There are local market considerations, too. 
In Latin America, for example, we are 
seeing an increase in healthcare spending. 
However, this is counterbalanced by high 
political risks – for example, high inflation 
rates in Venezuela and Argentina.
In China, meanwhile, a huge ageing 
population points to growing unmet 
medical needs in the future. As a result, 
healthcare is high on the Chinese govern-
ment’s agenda through general reform and 
programmes such as Healthy China 2030. 
Across IO, Novo Nordisk holds the leading 
diabetes value market share in most 
countries. In markets where this is not the 
case, we want to grow our share. In order 
to respond to the diverse conditions and 
trends across our geographic regions and 
therapeutic focus areas, we constantly eval-
uate our business decisions and fine-tune 
our strategy to make sure we meet local 
market needs and challenges. 
By combining this market fit approach 
with the business ethics enshrined in the 
Novo Nordisk Way, we believe we have 
the framework we need to achieve our 
commercial goals sustainably.
Growing fast and sustainably
2019 demonstrated that our commercial 
model is working. We accelerated our sales 
growth to 11% at CER in 2019 compared 
to around 5% at CER historically. This has 
been enabled by:
•   Changing demographics across geogra-
phies that lead to significant increase in 
unmet medical needs
•   Our market fit approach – where our re-
gional teams develop product strategies 
fit for their areas
• Our portfolio of products
Looking ahead, our ambition is to drive 
growth by establishing leadership in the 
basal insulin space, accelerating the growth 
of the GLP-1 market, and expanding the 
obesity market.
We want to broaden access to diabetes 
treatments – and make treatment more 
affordable. This is where we can strengthen 
our market leadership in basal insulin. 
Last year, Tresiba
®
 became available to 
patients in France, Germany and China, 
and we are already beginning to see more 
patients benefiting from this, our flagship 
next-generation basal insulin. In the next 
few years, we expect to launch Tresiba
®
 
and Xultophy
®
 in several other countries 
where new-generation insulin are not 
available today.

Whilst we remain value leaders in the 
GLP-1 market, we are facing increased 
competitive pressures and a decline in our 
market share in some IO regions. This year, 
we focused on turning this trend around. 
We are leveraging the label update for 
Victoza
®
 achieved on the basis of results 
from the LEADER trial, which showed that 
liraglutide is associated with significant 
cardiovascular risk reduction in people with 
type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, we are rolling 
out Ozempic
®
 as fast as we can  wherever 
there is a market opportunity. This is 
helping us to increase our share of market 
growth, bringing us closer to realising our 
medium-term ambition of more than 50%.
We are also planning launches of the first 
and only GLP-1 in a tablet, Rybelsus
®
, in 
the same timeframe. Because Rybelsus
®
 
will follow a route driven by general prac-
titioners and patient demands it is likely to 
put pressure on our field force capacities, 
as our representatives will have to reach 
far more healthcare professionals and have 
less time with each. We are mitigating this 
by exploring partnerships that can give 
us extra and flexible field force resources 
when we need them. 
To maximise the opportunity this presents, 
we have agreed to enter a co-promotion 
partnership with the major pharmaceu-
tical firm MSD, whose vast experience in 
marketing oral antidiabetics (OADs) to Jap-
anese diabetes specialists is key our efforts 
to bring the treatment into the hands of as 
many people as possible.
In Obesity care, we are investing to expand 
the market by working with a variety of 
stakeholders including policymakers to 
ensure that it is more widely recognised 
as a disease that can be tackled through 
medical intervention. 
Saxenda
®
 is already delivering value here, 
with around 72% of market growth 
over the last year. We plan for several 
more launches between 2020 and 2022, 
at which point we hope to be ready to 
introduce semaglutide for obesity into this 
fast-growing therapy area.
In Biopharm we will focus on expanding 
our footprint in haemophilia A and B. Hae-
mophilia A constitutes the largest patient 
population in haemophilia and our ability 
to secure a leading position in rare blood 
disorders will be driven by our success 
in growing sales with NovoEight
®
 and 
Esperoct
®
. Furthermore, we are confident 
that an increasing number of patients living 
with haemophilia B will choose Refixia
®
.
Combining research and commercial 
innovation
We believe Rybelsus
®
 – our semaglu-
tide-based oral diabetes medicine – will 
transform the lives of millions of people 
across IO by helping people to manage 
their disease. Our aim, therefore, is to 
secure broad access to this world-first 
innovation, and we are already taking steps 
to ensure this ahead of the product’s first 
IO launch.
We are also capitalising on innovation 
developments in different regions. For 
example, in China, the government’s push 
for innovation in healthcare is helping us 
broaden and deepen our relationships 
there. The Chinese government is enabling 
quicker clinical review and encouraging 
the use of generics to drive more cost- 
efficiency – meaning we will have shorter 
windows of opportunity and shorter 
 product  lifecycles.
To help Chinese patients better manage 
their diabetes, we are working closely 
with the government in China to provide 
digital healthcare solutions. One example is 
 WeDoctor – a nationwide medical consult-
ing platform connecting an astounding 172 
million patients and 300,000 doctors. This 
platform allows patients and doctors to 
stay in touch via a user-friendly mobile app.
But when it comes to delivering better 
treatments to people living with diabetes, 
obesity or other chronic diseases, commer-
cial innovation can be just as important 
as product innovation. This is why we 
 constantly assess and - if necessary - 
rethink the way we execute our strategy. 
This year, for example, we created separate 
teams for GLP-1, insulin and Biopharm, 
respectively, to give each area more focus 
and decision- making autonomy. •

Commercial execution:
North America  
Operations: Ready 
for growth in a  
challenging business 
environment
 
Around half of our global sales are generated in the US, making our 
North America operations – the US and Canada – a critical compo-
nent of our business. We are successfully transforming our business 
by utilising the potential of our innovative product offerings and 
we have strengthened our commitment to our social responsibility 
to make insulin available to all patients.
More than 30 million people in the 
US live with diabetes.
23
 Of those, millions 
remain undiagnosed and are not getting 
proper treatment. 
The numbers are just as alarming in obesity 
– if not more so. According the Centers for 
Disease Control & Prevention, more than 
93.3 million people were living with obesity 
in 2016
24
, costing the US healthcare system 
1.72 trillion US dollars annually.
25
The unmet needs are beyond question and 
have brought about new dynamics in the 
marketplace. Payer consolidation puts pres-
sure on prices of medicines, government 
interventions aim to address structural 
barriers to effective care, healthcare is 
undergoing a digital transformation, and 
across all of these looms the urgency of 
providing affordable care for uninsured and 
underinsured people like those in high-de-
ductible healthcare plans. 
Successfully adapting to the new busi-
ness environment 
In this challenging business environment, 
Novo Nordisk is going through a historic 
transition to remain a market leader and 
secure future growth, contributing to the 
company’s overall goal to achieve a global 
diabetes value market share of more than 
one-third. Towards 2022, it is expected that 
around 70% of sales will be from inno-
vative new products, while the remaining 
30% will be legacy products. To help us 
reach our medium-term goals, we have 
a clear growth strategy centred around 
bringing innovative new products to mar-
ket – and increasing our market share. 
Our GLP-1 offerings provide improved 
treatment for broader segments of pa-
tients. Meanwhile, we continue to deliver 
insulins and grow the volume amidst pric-
ing challenges. We are building the market 
for obesity care, enhancing growth oppor-
tunities for our innovative products. And 
we remain committed to serving patients 
with haemophilia and growth disorders.
Reaching significant milestones 
We have reached three very important 
milestones, all of which emphasise the 
strength of our existing – and future – GLP-
1 franchise:
•    Rybelsus
®
, our oral semaglutide medi-
cine for type 2 diabetes, was approved 
by the US Food & Drug Administration 
(FDA) in September 2019, with the 
first prescriptions written the following 
month,
•   In January 2020, Ozempic
® 
our 
once-weekly type 2 diabetes medicine,
 
was approved in the US for cardiovascu-
lar risk reduction in people with type 2 
diabetes and established cardiovascular 
disease.
•    Ozempic
®
 reached global blockbuster 
status in September 2019, with the bulk 
of sales generated in the US.
Innovating for diabetes leadership 
Our ultimate goal for diabetes treatment 
is to help patients live as full and healthy 
lives as possible. We want to change how 
the disease is treated and how it is viewed, 
offering products that meet medical needs 
and match patients’ lifestyles.
We built our position as the world’s larg-
est insulin producer through innovative 
injectable drugs. Going forward, we will 
transform the market with our indus-
try-first GLP-1 in a tablet, Rybelsus
®
. In the 
US, around 70% of diabetes prescriptions 
are for oral treatments, and so far none are 
from the highly effective GLP-1 class which 
we specialise in. We are confident that the 
launch of Rybelsus
®
 will change this.
But our focus is not only on portfolio inno-
vation; we also need to improve access and 
play a key role in prevention. This means 
effecting change everywhere that influenc-
es, or is influenced by the disease – includ-
ing research, education, public policy, as 
well as humanitarian and outreach efforts.

the US healthcare system calls for long-
term reform changes to make sustainable 
and meaningful affordability a reality. 
We are doing our part and updating our 
support offerings, engaging with multiple 
stakeholders. We acknowledge the role 
of list prices, but more needs to be done 
to improve how insurance benefits cover 
essential medicines, especially through high 
deductible health plans. See our offerings 
to provide affordable insulin in 'Leading a 
sustainable business'. 
Advocating for stronger obesity focus 
and policies
We have a clear ambition to offer medical 
treatment for more people with obesity 
and expect to double the sales of our 
obesity products globally by 2025. In the 
US and Canada, we work to bring superior 
treatments to market, and engage with 
key stakeholders and policymakers to make 
obesity a healthcare priority.
The launch of our Changing Obesity™ 
aspiration in January 2019 underscores 
our commitment to change how the world 
sees, treats and works to prevent obesity. 
In this effort we work with partners from 
both public and private sectors.
A case in point is our contribution – via an 
educational grant – to the establishment of 
the US Obesity Medicine Clinical Fellow-
ship Development Program. Thanks to this 
grant, the Obesity Society and the Obesity 
Medicine Association are working to in-
crease the number of physicians with spe-
cialised training in caring for and treating 
patients with obesity and its complications. 
In 2019, seven new Obesity Fellowships 
were awarded.
We also invested considerable time and 
resources in and joined forces with key 
stakeholders to advocate for the Treat 
and Reduce Obesity Act, a vital piece of 
legislation that will improve access to care 
for people with obesity. The Act addresses 
policy barriers to obesity care and cover-
age, including access to pharmacotherapy. 
All of these measures are helping shift 
social perspectives towards recognition of 
obesity as a chronic disease and empower 
people living with obesity in the US to seek 
and receive the respectful, complete care 
they deserve. 
Promising prospects in biopharm
Haemophilia remains a key focus in our 
biopharm business. We want to help 
patients living with this disease manage it 
better so they can lead healthier and more 
fulfilling lives.
The FDA approval of Esperoct
®
 in Febru-
ary 2019 and the Breakthrough Therapy 
Designation for concizumab for prophylaxis 
treatment in people with haemophilia B 
with inhibitors were important milestones 
in the fight against this serious chronic 
disease.
In our growth disorders business, we are 
awaiting the response on somapacitan – 
a new long-acting growth hormone for 
treatment in adults with growth hormone 
deficiency, which we submitted for the 
US FDA regulatory approval in September 
2019. •

Financials
Financials:
2019 performance and 
2020 outlook
Financial performance
Novo Nordisk's 2019 performance for sales 
measured at constant exchange rates (CER) 
exceed the outlook provided in February 
2019, while operating profit measured at 
CER was within the range provided in Feb-
ruary 2019. The free cash flow marginally 
exceeded the outlook provided in February 
2019, while the tax rate was lower follow-
ing a positive impact from non-recurring 
changes to deferred tax assets. Capital 
expenditure was broadly in line with the 
guidance provided in February 2019.
Geographic sales development
Sales increased by 9% measured in Danish 
kroner and by 6% at CER to DKK 122,021 
million in 2019. Sales in International 
Operations increased by 12% measured in 
Danish kroner and by 11% at CER. Sales in 
North America Operations increased by 6% 
measured in Danish kroner and by 1% at 
CER. The sales growth is in line with the lat-
est guidance of '5-6% sales growth at CER' 
provided in connection with the announce-
ment in November 2019 for the financial 
results of the first nine months of 2019.
Sales development across  
therapeutic areas
Sales growth in 2019 was 9% measured in 
Danish kroner and 6% at CER was driven 
by solid growth across all therapy areas with 
Diabetes care sales growth of 4% (CER), 
Obesity care sales growth of 42% (CER) 
and Biopharm sales growth of 4% (CER).
Diabetes care, sales development
Sales in Diabetes care increased by 8% 
measured in Danish kroner and by 4% at 
CER to DKK 97,161 million driven by solid 
GLP-1 growth, partly offset by declining 
insulin sales. Novo Nordisk has improved 
its global diabetes value market share over 
the last 12 months from 27.8% to 28.6%, 
driven by improved global insulin market 
share and growth of the GLP-1 segment, 
reflecting an expansion of the diabetes 
value market share in North America 
Operations and a stabilisation of the value 
market share in International Operations.
In the following sections, unless otherwise 
noted, market data are based on moving 
annual total (MAT) from November 2019

Sales of insulin remained unchanged in 
Danish kroner and decreased by 3% at CER 
to DKK 59,693 million. The decreased sales 
measured at CER were driven by declining 
sales in the USA, partly offset by increased 
sales in International Operations.
Sales of long-acting insulin remained 
unchanged in Danish kroner and decreased 
by 4% at CER to DKK 20,776 million. Novo 
Nordisk has improved its global volume 
market share in the long-acting insulin seg-
ment from 31.6% to 32.4% in the last 12 
months. The decreased sales measured at 
CER were driven by declining Levemir
®
 sales, 
partly offset by a positive impact from Tresi-
ba
®
 and Xultophy
®
. Tresiba
®
 has now been 
launched in 86 countries, while Xultophy
®
 
has now been launched in 37 countries.
Sales of premix insulin increased by 4% 
measured in Danish kroner and by 2% at 
CER to DKK 10,578 million. Novo  Nordisk 
is market leader in the premix insulin 
segment with a global volume market 
share of 63.9%, which has been broadly 
unchanged over the past 12 months. The 
increased sales were driven by increased 
sales of Ryzodeg
®
,
 partly offset by declining 
NovoMix
®
 sales. Ryzodeg
®
 has now been 
launched in 30 countries.
Sales of fast-acting insulin remained un-
changed in Danish kroner and decreased 
by 3% at CER to DKK 19,303 million. 
Novo Nordisk is market leader in the 
fast-acting insulin segment with a global 
volume market share of 50.7%, which has 
been  broadly unchanged over the past 12 
months. The decreasing sales measured 
at CER were driven by declining sales of 
 NovoRapid
®
, partly offset by a positive 
impact from Fiasp
®
. Fiasp
®
 has now been 
launched in 33 countries.

Sales of human insulin decreased by 2% 
measured in Danish kroner and by 5% at 
CER to DKK 9,036 million.
GLP-1 therapy for type 2 diabetes 
Sales of GLP-1 products for type 2 diabe-
tes (Victoza
®
, Ozempic
®
 and Rybelsus
®
) 
increased by 27% measured in Danish 
kroner and by 22% at CER to DKK 33,221 
million. Sales growth was driven by both 
North America Operations and Inter-
national Operations. Sales of Ozempic
®
 
were DKK 11,237 million and Ozempic
® 
has now been launched in 26 countries in 
North America Operations, Region Europe, 
Region Latin America and Region AAMEO. 
The GLP-1 segment’s value share of the to-
tal diabetes market has increased to 18.0% 
compared with 14.4% 12 months ago. 
Novo Nordisk continues to be the global 
market leader in the GLP-1 segment with a 
47.5% value market share.
Obesity care, sales development 
Sales of Saxenda
®
 increased by 47% 
measured in Danish kroner and by 42% at 
CER to DKK 5,679 million. Sales growth of 
Saxenda
®
 was driven by both International 
Operations and North America Operations. 
Saxenda
®
 has now been launched in 46 
countries. Novo Nordisk currently has a 
value market share of 56% of the global 
obesity prescription drug market.
Biopharm
Biopharm, sales development
Sales of biopharm products increased by 
7% measured in Danish kroner and by 4% 
at CER to DKK 19,181 million. The sales 
development was driven by sales growth 
in both operating units as well as across 
both franchises: Haemophilia and Growth 
disorders. Sales growth in International 
Operations was driven by Region Latin 
America, Region AAMEO, Region China 
and Region Japan & Korea.
Haemophilia
Sales of haemophilia products increased 
by 7% measured in Danish kroner and by 
4% at CER to DKK 10,281 million. The in-
creasing sales were driven by the continued 
global roll-out of Refi
xia
®
 and NovoEight
®
. 
Novo Nordisk continues to expand its 
broad global haemophilia presence.
Sales of NovoSeven
®
 increased by 3% 
measured in Danish kroner, and remained 
unchanged at CER, to DKK 8,119 million, 
re
flecting the solid position of NovoSeven
®
 
as a haemostatic agent in critical treatment 
settings and a wide range of labelled indi-
cations in an increasingly competitive envi-
ronment. The sales development is driven 
by increased sales in Region Latin America, 
Region AAMEO and Region China as well 
as stable sales in North America Operations 
offset by declining sales in Region Europe 
and Region Japan & Korea.
Sales of NovoEight
®
 increased by 13% 
measured in Danish kroner and by 10% at 
CER to DKK 1,525 million. Sales growth 
was driven by Region Latin America, 
Region AAMEO, Region Europe and North 
America Operations. NovoEight
®
 has now 
been launched in 52 countries.
Sales of Refixia
®
 increased to DKK 382 
million. Sales growth was driven by the 
product launches in Region Europe, 
Region Japan & Korea and North  America 
 Operations.  Refixia
®
 has now been 
launched in 16 countries.
Esperoct
®
 has now been launched in nine 
countries and the initial feedback from 
patients and physicians is encouraging.
Growth disorders (Norditropin
®
)
Sales of growth disorder products increased 
by 6% measured in Danish kroner and 
by 2% at CER to DKK 7,275 million. The 
increasing sales were driven by Internation-
al Operations increasing by 3% at CER and 
by North America Operations increasing 
by 2% at CER. Novo Nordisk is the leading 
company in the global human growth 
disorder market with a market share mea-
sured in value of around 33% driven by 
new indications and the introduction of the 
next-generation device.
Development in costs and  
operating profit
The cost of goods sold increased by 14% 
measured in Danish kroner and by 12% at 
CER to DKK 20,088 million, resulting in a 
gross margin of 83.5% measured in Danish 
kroner, compared with 84.2% in 2018. The 
decrease in gross margin reflects a negative 
impact from lower realised prices in the 
USA and impairment of intangible assets, 
partly countered by a positive product 
mix driven by increased GLP-1 sales and a 
positive currency impact of 0.3 percentage 
point.
Sales and distribution costs increased by 
8% measured in Danish kroner and by 6% 
at CER to DKK 31,823 million. The increase 
in sales and distribution costs was

driven by International Operations reflect-
ing resource allocation to growth markets 
and promotional activities for Victoza
®
 and 
launch activities for Ozempic
®
, promotional 
activities for insulin, particularly in China, 
as well as promotional activities for the 
continued roll-out of Saxenda
®
. In the 
USA, promotional activities are focusing on 
Ozempic
®
 and Saxenda
®
 as well as launch 
activities for Rybelsus
®
, partly offset by 
 lower promotional spend related to insulin.
Research and development costs decreased 
by 4% measured in Danish kroner and by 
6% at CER to DKK 14,220 million, posi-
tively impacted by reversal of write-downs 
of prelaunch inventory in first quarter of 
2019 following the filing of Rybelsus
®
 to 
the US FDA, severance costs in second half 
of 2018 and the expense of the priority 
review voucher for Rybelsus
®
 in fourth 
quarter of 2018 partly offset by impair-
ment of intangible assets in 2019. The 
underlying increase in R&D costs is driven 
by increased costs for the semaglutide 
in obesity clinical programmes STEP and 
SELECT, the ramp-up of the SOUL cardio-
vascular outcomes trial with Rybelsus
®
 as 
well as increased costs for the semaglutide 
NASH development activities, partly offset 
by the completion of the Rybelsus
®
 phase 
3a development programme and the com-
pletion of the head-to-head study between 
Tresiba
®
 and insulin glargine U300.
Administration costs increased by 2% mea-
sured in Danish kroner and by 1% at CER 
to DKK 4,007 million, reflecting increased 
legal costs while spend across administra-
tive areas was broadly unchanged.
Other operating income (net) was DKK 
600 million compared with DKK 1,152 
million in 2018. The decline in Other 
operating income (net) in 2019 compared 
with 2018 reflects non-recurring income in 
2018 and decrease in income from licence 
 agreements.
Operating profit increased by 11% in 
Danish kroner and by 6% at CER to DKK 
52,483 million, which is in line with the 
latest guidance for operating profit growth 
measured at CER of '4-6%' in 2019.
Financial items (net) and tax
Financial items (net) showed a net loss of 
DKK 3,930 million compared with a net 
gain of DKK 367 million in 2018. The re-
ported net financial items in 2019 is in line 
with the latest guidance of 'loss of around 
DKK 3.9 billion'.
In line with Novo Nordisk’s treasury policy, 
the most significant foreign exchange risks 
for the Group have been hedged,  primarily 
through foreign exchange forward con-
tracts. The foreign exchange result was a 
loss of DKK 3,212 million compared with 
a gain of DKK 298 million in 2018. This 
development reflects a loss on foreign 
exchange hedging, especially related to the 
US dollar versus the Danish krone.
As per the end of December 2019, a 
negative market value of financial contracts 
of approximately DKK 0.3 billion has been 
deferred for recognition in 2020.
The effective tax rate was 19.8% in 2019 
compared with an effective tax rate of 
18.9% in 2018. The reported effective 
tax rate of 19.8% is in line with the latest 
guidance of a tax rate of '19-21%' for 
2019.  The effective tax rate for 2019 was 
positively impacted by minor non-recurring 
changes to deferred tax assets following 
the approval of the Swiss tax reform, while 
non-recurring changes in tax provisions 
related to settlement of international tax 
cases positively impacted the 2018 tax rate.
Capital expenditure and free cash 
flow
Capital expenditure for property, plant and 
equipment was DKK 8.9 billion compared 
with DKK 9.6 billion in 2018, which is in

Free cash flow
line with the latest guidance of 'around

primarily related to investments in a new 
production facility for diabetes active phar-
maceutical ingredients in Clayton, North 
Carolina, USA, expansion of production 
facilities in Kalundborg, Denmark, expan-
sion of production facilities in Chartres, 
France and a new diabetes filling capacity 
in Hillerød, Denmark.
Free cash flow was DKK 34.5 billion com-
pared with DKK 32.5 billion in 2018, which 
is in line with the latest guidance of 'DKK 
31-35 billion'. The increase of 6% com-
pared with 2018 primarily reflects increased 
cash from operating activities driven by the 
timing of rebate payments in the USA.

Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2019

For 2020, sales growth is expected to 
be 3% to 6%, measured at CER. This 
guidance reflects expectations for robust 
performance for the GLP-1-based diabetes 
care products Ozempic
®
, Victoza
® 
and Ry-
belsus
®
, the obesity care product Saxenda
®
, 
the portfolio of new-generation insulin and 
the contribution from the biopharm prod-
ucts Esperoct
®
, Refixia
®
 and NovoEight
®
. 
The guidance also reflects intensifying com-
petition both within Diabetes care and Bio-
pharm, especially within the haemophilia 
inhibitor segment. Furthermore, continued 
pricing pressure within Diabetes care as 
well as expansion of already announced af-
fordability initiatives, especially in the USA, 
are expected to impact sales development. 
Given the current exchange rates versus 
the Danish krone, growth reported in DKK 
is expected to be around 1 percentage 
point higher than at CER.
For 2020, operating profit growth is expect-
ed to be 1% to 5%, measured at CER. The 
expectation for operating profit growth pri-
marily reflects the sales growth outlook and 
continued focus on resource allocation. Op-
erating profit growth is negatively impacted 
by increased investments in commercial 
activities related to the commercial priorities 
across the operating units including the 
introduction of Rybelsus
®
 in the USA, the 
continued global expansion of the injectable 
GLP-1 diabetes franchise, the global invest-
ment in building an anti-obesity market 
and the promotional activities for roll-out of 
the Biopharm portfolio. Given the current 
exchange rates versus the Danish krone, 
growth reported in DKK is expected to be 1 
percentage point higher than at CER.
For 2020, Novo Nordisk expects financial 
items (net) to amount to a loss of around 
DKK 1.5 billion, offsetting the positive 
currency impact on operating profit. The 
current expectation for 2020 primarily 
reflects losses associated with foreign 
exchange hedging contracts, mainly related 
to the US dollar and Chinese yuan versus 
the Danish krone.
The effective tax rate for 2020 is expected 
to be in the range of 20-22%.
Capital expenditure is expected to be 
around DKK 6.5 billion in 2020, primarily 
relating to investments in additional ca-
pacity for active pharmaceutical ingredient 
(API) production within Diabetes care and 
an expansion of thefilling capacity within 
Diabetes care. Depreciation, amortisation 
and impairment losses are expected to be 
around DKK 5 billion. The decline in depre-
ciation, amortisation and impairment losses 
in 2020, compared with the level in 2019, 
reflects higher levels of impairment losses 
in 2019. Free cash flow is expected to be 
DKK 36-41 billion.
All of the above expectations are based 
on assumptions that the global or regional 
economic and political environment will 
not significantly change business conditions 
for Novo Nordisk during 2020, including 
the potential implications from major 
healthcare reforms, and that the currency 
exchange rates, especially the US dollar, 
will remain at the current level versus the 
Danish krone. Neither does the guidance 
include the financial implications in case 
of a significant bolt-on acquisition during 
2020. Furthermore, the guidance does not 
include any significant impact from the 
outbreak of coronavirus.
Novo Nordisk has hedged expected net 
cash flows in a number of invoicing cur-
rencies and, all other things being equal, 
 movements in key invoicing currencies will 
impact Novo Nordisk’s operating profit as 
outlined in the table Key invoicing currencies.
Long-term financial targets
Novo Nordisk introduced four long-term 
financial targets in 1996 to balance short- 
and long-term considerations . The targets 
were subsequently revised and updated 
on several occasions, most recently in con-
nection with the Annual Report for 2018 
released in February 2019.
With the performance in 2019, Novo Nor-
disk has met its long-term financial targets 
comprising average operating profit growth 
of 5%, cash-to-earnings of 85% (3-year 
average) and operating profit after tax over 
net operating assets (OPAT/NOA) of 80%.

Strategic aspirations for 2025
To reflect the broad growth aspects of 
Novo Nordisk across therapy areas and 
geographies, the historic approach to long-
term financial targets focusing on specific 
financial aspects is no longer sufficiently 
describing Novo Nordisk’s future growth 
outlook. Consequently, Novo Nordisk 
announced in connection with its Capital 
Markets Day in November 2019 that it is 
replacing the current long-term financial 
targets structure with a more comprehen-
sive approach describing the future growth 
aspirations of the company under the 
headline: Strategic aspirations for 2025.
The strategic aspirations, reflecting the 
sustained growth opportunities until 2025, 
are intended to cover future growth drivers 
of Novo Nordisk and thereby providing 
investors with an understanding of Novo 
 Nordisk’s growth and investment opportu-
nities across therapy areas and geographies.
The strategic aspirations are objectives that 
Novo Nordisk intends to work towards 
and are not a projection of Novo Nordisk's 
financial outlook or expected growth. Novo 
Nordisk intends to describe how its activi-
ties develop in relation to each of the four 
dimensions on an ongoing basis.
Forward-looking statements
Novo Nordisk’s reports filed with or fur-
nished to the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), including this statutory 
Annual Report 2019 and Form 20-F, which 
are both expected to be filed with the SEC 
in February 2020 in continuation of the 
publication of this Annual Report 2019, 
and written information released, or oral 
statements made, to the public in the 
future by or on behalf of Novo Nordisk, 
may contain forward-looking statements. 
Words such as ‘believe’, ‘expect’, ‘may’, 
‘will’, ‘plan’, ‘strategy’, ‘prospect’, ‘foresee’, 
‘estimate’, ‘project’, ‘anticipate’, ‘can’, ‘in-
tend’, ‘target’ and other words and terms 
of similar meaning in connection with any 
discussion of future operating or financial 
performance identify forward-looking state-
ments. Examples of such forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to: 
•   statements of targets, plans, objectives 
or goals for future operations, includ-
ing those related to Novo Nordisk’s 
products, product research, product 
development, product introductions and 
product approvals as well as cooperation 
in relation thereto,
•   statements containing projections of or 
targets for revenues, costs, income (or 
loss), earnings per share, capital expen-
ditures, dividends, capital structure, net 
financials and other financial measures,
•   statements regarding future  economic 
performance, future actions and out-
come of contingencies such as legal 
proceedings, and
•   statements regarding the assump-
tions underlying or relating to such 
 statements.
In this Annual Report 2019, examples of 
forward-looking statements can be found 
under the headings '2019 Performance 
and 2020 outlook' and elsewhere.
These statements are based on current 
plans, estimates and projections. By their 
very nature, forward-looking statements in-
volve inherent risks and uncertainties, both 
general and specific. Novo Nordisk cautions 
that a number of important factors, includ-
ing those described in this Annual Report 
2019, could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those contemplated in any 
forward-looking statements.
Factors that may affect future results 
include, but are not limited to, global 
as well as local political and economic 
conditions, including interest rate and 
currency exchange rate fluctuations, delay 
or failure of projects related to research 
and/or development, unplanned loss of 
patents, interruptions of supplies and 
production, product recalls, unexpected 
contract breaches or terminations, gov-
ernment-mandated or market-driven price 
decreases for Novo Nordisk’s products, in-
troduction of competing products, reliance 
on information technology, Novo Nordisk’s 
ability to successfully market current and 
new products, exposure to product liability 
and legal proceedings and investigations, 
changes in governmental laws and related 
interpretation thereof, including on reim-
bursement, intellectual property protec-
tion and regulatory controls on testing, 
approval, manufacturing and marketing, 
perceived or actual failure to adhere to 
ethical marketing practices, investments in 
and divestitures of domestic and foreign 
companies, unexpected growth in costs 
and expenses, failure to recruit and retain 
the right employees, and failure to main-
tain a culture of compliance.
For an overview of some, but not all, 
of the risks that could adversely affect 
Novo Nordisk’s results or the accuracy of 
forward-looking statements in this Annual 
Report 2019, reference is made to the 
overview of risk factors in ‘Managing risks 
to protect value’ of this Annual Report 
2019.
Unless required by law, Novo Nordisk is 
under no duty and undertakes no obliga-
tion to update or revise any forward-look-
ing statement after the distribution of 
this Annual Report 2019, whether as a 
result of new information, future events or 
otherwise. •

Research and 
development 
In 2019, we made significant prog-
ress in research and development pipeline, 
reaching several important regulatory 
milestones. Key development projects are 
highlighted below, along with a pipeline 
overview of compounds in clinical develop-
ment. Further details on clinical trials can 
be found in company announcements and 
press releases published by Novo Nordisk 
during 2019, available at novonordisk.com
Diabetes care
Regulatory events 
We submitted a New Drug Applications 
(NDA) to the US Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) for oral semaglutide, a 
once-daily glucacon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
receptor agonist, as a treatment to improve 
glycaemic control in adults with type 2 dia-
betes. This resulted in FDA approval in Sep-
tember 2019, of the first GLP-1 in a tablet, 
Rybelsus
®
. The approval was based on the 
phase 3a PIONEER development pro-
gramme, which included 9,543 adults with 
type 2 diabetes. We launched Rybelsus
®
 in 
the US in the fourth quarter of 2019.
A second NDA was submitted for oral 
semaglutide and a supplementary NDA 
(sNDA) for Ozempic
®
 (once-weekly inject-
able semaglutide), seeking approval for a 
separate indication for cardiovascular risk 
reduction in adults with type 2 diabetes. 
These applications are based on results 
from two cardiovascular outcomes trials 
(CVOTs) evaluating the effects of adding 
semaglutide or placebo to standard of 
care on the risk of cardiovascular events, 
namely, PIONEER 6 with oral semaglutide 
and SUSTAIN 6 with Ozempic
®
. On the 
basis of the submitted data, Ozempic
®
 
was approved in the USA for cardiovas-
cular risk reduction in people with type 
2 diabetes. The Rybelsus
®
 US label was 
updated with additional results from the 
PIONEER 6 trial.
On 31 January the committee for  medicinal 
products for human use (CHMP) under 
the EMA adopted a positive opinion, 
recommending marketing authorisation for 
Rybelsus
®
 (oral semaglutide) for the treat-
ment of adults with type 2 diabetes. We 
expect to receive final marketing authorisa-
tion from the European Commission in the 
beginning of second quarter of 2020.
Based on the ELLIPSE trial, we obtained a 
label expansion for Victoza
®
 which now in-
cludes an indication for the use in children 
and adolescent, aged 10-17 with type 2 
diabetes in the US and Europe.
Clinical progress 
The SOUL trial was initiated, a dedicated 
 diabetes cardiovascular outcome trial, 
aiming to confirm the cardiovascular 
benefits of oral semaglutide and expand 
the scientific evidence base of  semaglutide. 
The SOUL trial is expected to enrol 
 approximately 9,600 people.
Three phase 3b trials were initiated with 
subcutaneous (sc) once-weekly semaglu-
tide: SUSTAIN FORTE, with the objective 
to compare and assess the efficacy and 
safety of sc semaglutide 2 mg compared to 
sc semaglutide 1 mg in people with type 
2 diabetes. FOCUS, a diabetic retinopathy 
outcomes trial, with the objective to assess 
the long-term effects of sc semaglutide in 
people with type 2 diabetes. Lastly, FLOW, 
a diabetic nephropathy outcomes trial, with 
the objective of assessing the effect of sc 
semaglutide on the progression of renal 
impairment in people with type 2 diabetes 
and chronic kidney disease.
Furthermore, Novo Nordisk completed 
a phase 2 trial with the combination of 
anti-IL-21 and liraglutide in people with 
newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. The trial 
demonstrated statistically significantly im-
proved beta cell function with anti-IL-21 in 
combination with liraglutide compared to 
placebo. Together with regulatory authori-
ties, Novo Nordisk is evaluating next steps.
Lastly, Novo Nordisk completed the 26-week 
phase 2 trial with insulin icodec (previously 
named LAI287). Insulin icodec is anticipated 
to be the first once-weekly insulin and have 
similar glucose-lowering effect and safety 
profile to once-daily insulin glargine U100. 
Based on the phase 2 results, Novo Nordisk 
plans to initiate a phase 3 clinical trial pro-
gramme in second half of 2020.
Obesity care
Clinical progress 
We initiated a phase 2 trial for the long-act-
ing amylin analogue AM833, intended 
for chronic weight management with a 
once-weekly subcutaneous administration. 
Biopharm
Regulatory events
We obtained approval of Esperoct
®
 (the 
brand name for N8-GP) in the US, the EU 
and Japan for prophylaxis and on-demand 
treatment of all age groups, in the EU above 
12 years of age, of haemophilia A patients.
In addition, the regulatory file was submit-
ted for the once-weekly growth hormone 
derivative, somapacitan, for the treatment 
of adult growth hormone deficiency, to the 
US FDA and EMA. 
Clinical progress 
We initiated the phase 3 programme (REAL 
4) for somapacitan in children with growth
hormone deficiency.
Furthermore, we initiated the explorer7 
and explorer8 phase 3 clinical trials with 
subcutaneous prophylactic treatment of 
concizumab in people with haemophilia A 
or B with inhibitors and a parallel trial in 
haemophilia A or B patients without inhib-
itors. The objective of these trials is to es-
tablish the safety and efficacy of once-daily 
subcutaneous concizumab as a pen device 
based on prophylactic treatment to reduce 
the number of bleeds. 
We initiated the phase 1/2 trial for Mim8. 
Mim8 is a next-generation factor VIII mi-
metic bi-specific antibody for subcutaneous 
prophylaxis of haemophilia A regardless of 
inhibitor status.
Other serious chronic diseases
Clinical progress 
Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Novo Nordisk 
established a collaboration on clinical trial 
activities, by combining compounds from 
their respective pipelines in non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH). The clinical trial 
is a proof-of-concept study combining 
Novo Nordisk's semaglutide and Gilead's 
small molecules; the FXR agonist cilofexor 
and the ACC inhibitor firsocostat for the 
treatment of people with NASH. Results are 
expected in the first half of 2020.
Finally, we initiated the first human dose trial 
(phase 1) for a subcutaneous PCSK9i. The 
trial is designed as a dose escalation trial 
with the aim to establish the safety, tolera-
bility and pharmacokinetics of PCSK9i. The 
trial will form the basis for a review of the 
options for further drug development of a 
PCSK9i within the cardiometabolic space. •

Social performance
Novo Nordisk accounts for social 
performance on three dimensions: patients, 
employees and responsible business in 
pursuit of the ambition to be a sustainable 
business. Policies, actions and governance 
oversight are in place to prevent any un-
wanted impacts and promote social progress 
through global access to healthcare, a safe, 
healthy and inclusive working environment 
with equal opportunities for all, business 
conduct with respect of others ́ integrity and 
human rights, and financial contributions to 
communities where Novo Nordisk operates.
Patients 
Novo Nordisk is committed to driving 
change to defeat diabetes and other serious 
chronic diseases. To fulfil this purpose, Novo 
Nordisk pioneers scientific breakthroughs, 
expand access to our medicines, and work 
to prevent and ultimately cure disease.
In 2019, Novo Nordisk provided medical 
treatment to an estimated 30.0 million peo-
ple with diabetes worldwide, compared with 
29.2 in 2018. This 3% increase was primar-
ily driven by sales of long-acting, premix and 
fast-acting insulins and GLP-1 products.
Through Novo Nordisk’s Access to Insulin 
Commitment, the company guarantees to 
provide low-priced human insulin to gov-
ernments in the poorest parts of the world 
and selected humanitarian organisations 
at a ceiling price of USD 4 per vial. As of 
2019, the guarantee is expanded to include 
an additional 29 middle-income countries. 
This means that a total of 78 countries, as 
well as selected humanitarian organisa-
tions, can benefit from this guarantee. An 
estimated 2.9 million people were treated 
with insulin under this commitment in 
2019, of which approximately 200,000 
people were reached through sales to 
humanitarian organisations. In 2019, the 
average price the insulin was sold at equals 
USD 0.12 per patient per day. Beyond this 
commitment, Novo Nordisk sold human 
insulin at or below the ceiling price in other 
countries, reaching an estimated additional 
2.2 million people in 2019.
Novo Nordisk has several initiatives, 
programmes and partnerships focused on 
increasing access to care all over the world. 
See novonordisk.com.
Novo Nordisk takes a patient-centred ap-
proach in its care delivery model and learns 
with patients. For additional information, 
see the 'Our Business section' and  
novonordisk.com.
Employees 
Novo Nordisk aims to be an attractive 
employer that offers a safe and healthy, 
inclusive and engaging working environ-
ment in which all employees have equal 
opportunities to realise their potential. 
At the end of 2019, the total number of 
employees was 43,258, corresponding to 
42,703 full-time positions, which is a less 
than 1% increase compared with 2018. 
The underlying growth in employees was 
mainly driven by Region China. Employee 
turnover decreased from 11.7% in 2018 to 
11.4%.
Novo Nordisk’s responsibility to respect la-
bour rights applies to our global operations 
as a global minimum standard of business 
conduct. In 2019, the Global Labour Code 
of Conduct was revitalised and reinforced 
to ensure alignment with Novo Nordisk’s 
Business Ethics Compliance Framework, 
which includes respect of human rights. 
The Code of Conduct describes expected 
global minimum labour rights requirements 
for Novo Nordisk employees including the 
principles concerning fundamental rights in 
the eight ILO Core Conventions and labour 
rights as stipulated in the International Bill 
of Human Rights. Minimum paid maternity 
leave is increased from 12 to 14 weeks 
globally and a right to paid paternity leave 
is introduced. Moreover, guidance to avoid 
forced and bonded labour/child labour 
and young workers is better described, the 
right to social security is affirmed, and life 
insurance for all employees is introduced. 
For more information see   
novonordisk.com.
In addition, Novo Nordisk entered a 5-year 
living wage programme with an external 
global non-profit business network and 
consultancy. The objective is to ensure that 
all employees are paid a living wage, i.e. 
adequate to purchase basic goods and ser-
vices necessary to achieve a basic standard 
of living, based on calculations of living 
wages in the countries we operate in. An 
analysis indicated that this is the case. 
By the end of 2019, the gender distribution 
among managers was 60% men and 40% 
women, unchanged from 2018. 
Through 2019 diversity and inclusion have 
been strategic and tactical priorities for 
Novo Nordisk. The launch of the Diversity 
Aspiration of achieving gender balance at 
all managerial levels and the Diversity Ac-
tion Plan with new guidelines and flexible 
working conditions have created direction 
towards becoming a more inclusive compa-
ny. Novo Nordisk acknowledges the impor-
tance of leadership role modelling inclusive 
behaviour to lead a sustainable work place 
where everyone is able to perform at their 
best. The strong stance on diversity and 
inclusion will continue in 2020 with focus 
on realising continuous impact from the 
initiatives.
Novo Nordisk is committed to ensuring 
fair and equal treatment, opportunities – 
and pay – for all employees regardless of 
gender. In 2019, we conducted a study on 
gender and equal pay covering more than 
50 countries and over 25,000 employees in 
order to reveal any differences in pay level 
or annual bonus due to gender. In a few 
locations, we identified some differences 
that need to be further investigated, and 
if due to gender, corrected. The equal pay 
study will be repeated in 2020 to ensure a 
continued focus.
The average frequency rate of occupational 
accidents with absence was 2.2 per million 
working hours in 2019 compared with 
2.4 in 2018. In 2019, Novo Nordisk had 
one work-related fatality compared with 
none in 2018. Novo Nordisk works with a 
zero-injury mindset and remains com-
mitted to continuously improving safety 
performance. Employees are encouraged 
to always make the safe choice, and it is 
emphasised that safety behaviour is part of 
the company values.

Responsible business
Measures are taken to ensure that Novo 
Nordisk conducts its business in a respon-
sible way, in accordance with the Novo 
Nordisk Way.                                   
Business ethics, data privacy and  
human rights
In Novo Nordisk Business Ethics, Data Priva-
cy and Human Rights is about acting with 
integrity and in compliance with the Novo 
Nordisk Way, the Business Ethics Code of 
Conduct as well as international and local 
standards for responsible business conduct.
T
raining in Business Ethics is mandatory 
and a high priority. Annual Business Ethics 
training is required for all employees, includ-
ing new hires. Business Ethics training is 
therefore a key element of the onboarding 
programmes. In 2019, 99% of all relevant 
employees completed and documented 
their training. This high 
level is attributed to 
the constant focus on and communication 
by senior management of the importance 
of business ethics compliance. In 2019, 34 
business ethics reviews were completed 
with 87 findings, compared with 33 re-
views with 113 fi
ndings in 2018. Based on 
the completed business ethics reviews, it is 
Group Internal Audit's assessment that the 
business ethics compliance level is sound. 
Management action plans and closure of 
fi
ndings progressed as planned, and there 
were no overdue Management actions or 
fi
ndings at the end of the year.
During 2019 Novo Nordisk developed and 
approved its internal corporate require-
ments on Data Privacy and Human Rights 
which is operationalised in the Novo 
Nordisk’s Business Ethics Code of Conduct. 
The requirements set out guidance and 
expectations to all employees. Furthermore, 
Data Privacy and Human Rights risks (‘risks 
to people’) were integrated into the Busi-
ness Ethics risk methodology, as the basis 
for risk management in the Novo Nordisk 
global organisation as of 2020.
Progress was made in regard to manage-
ment of salient human rights issues beyond 
those already addressed by existing global 
standards and programmes. In 2019, for 
patient safety and the right to health, 
we further increased the share of Novo 
Nordisk subsidiaries providing access 
to safety reporting with local language 
directions on local websites, from 90% in 
2018 to 96% in 2019. For availability and 
affordability aspects of the right to health, 
see progress above. To mitigate risks of 
exploitation and ensure respect for donors’ 
right to free and informed consent among 
others, we evaluated and delisted human 
biosample providers and reduced the ratio 
of the unevaluated providers we use, from 
12% in 2018 to 6% in 2019. We have 
also developed a risk-based global due 
diligence system. The Responsible Sourcing 
standards were updated in December 2019 
to strengthen its human rights coverage. 
For our due diligence on modern slavery 
risks, see Novo Nordisk’s Modern Slavery 
Statement at novonordisk.com.
In 2019, a total of 236 supplier audits, un-
dertaken by Novo Nordisk's own organisa-
tion, were conducted to assess compliance 
levels with the company's standards for 
suppliers. Of these, 27 were responsible 
sourcing audits and one critical finding was 
issued r
egarding working hours. An action 
plan with deadlines has been agreed upon 
and a re-audit is planned for 2020.
Product quality 
Novo Nordisk had four product recalls from 
the market in 2019, compared with three 
in 2018. As in 2018, none of the recalls 
were critical. Local health authorities were 
informed in all instances to ensure that dis-
tributors, pharmacies, doctors and patients 
received appropriate information.
In 2019, as in 2018, there were no failed 
inspections by regulatory authorities 
among those resolved at year-end. In 
2019, 66 inspections were conducted at 
Novo Nordisk’s sites, at clinics conducting 
investigations for Novo Nordisk or for 
voluntary ISO 9001 certification, compared 
with 75 inspections in 2018. At year
-end, 
44 inspections had been passed and 22 
were unresolved. Follow up on unresolved 
inspection continues in 2020.
Responsible tax approach
Novo Nordisk’s tax approach is to pursue 
a competitive tax level in a responsible 
way. As a general rule, Novo Nordisk 
subsidiaries pay corporate taxes in the 
countries in which they operate and where 
business activity generates profits, earned 
in accordance with international transfer 
pricing rules. A competitive tax level implies 
achieving a tax level around the peer-group 
average. The company has a balanced tax 
risk profile and does not engage in tax 
avoidance activities. See 'Note 2.6 income 
taxes and deferred income taxes' and 'Note 
9.8 total tax contribution'.
To create certainty regarding tax payments, 
Novo Nordisk has applied for advance 
pricing agreements (APAs) in key countries. 
The ambition is to have APAs covering 
more than two-thirds of total sales. An 
APA is an up-front agreement between the 
tax authorities in two or more countries, 
covering the pricing methodologies for rel-
evant intercompany transactions, thereby 
determining the level of taxable income for 
the countries in question. An APA typically 
covers a future period of five tax years.
Novo Nordisk has APAs in place covering 
intercompany transactions with the US, 
Canada, Japan, India and China corre-
sponding to more than 60% of total sales. 
Novo Nordisk's tax strategy is endorsed by 
the Board of Directors.
Long-term social targets 
Novo Nordisk has two long-term social 
targets related to employee engagement 
and trust.
The level of employee engagement and 
commitment to the company’s values re-
mains high. In the annual employee survey, 
conducted in the second quarter of 2019, 
91% of employees responded positively to 
a set of questions to measure the level of 
engagement, same as in 2018. The target 
is at least 90%.  
The level of trust in Novo Nordisk among 
key stakeholders - people with diabetes, 
general practitioners and diabetes special-
ists - is an indicator of the extent to which 
the company lives up to stakeholders' ex-
pectations and the likelihood that they will 
trust, support and engage with the com-
pany. The company trust score, measured 
on a scale of 0-100, decreased to 78.2 
from 84.5 in 2018. The decline in trust can 
best be explained by the increased scrutiny 
on pharma industry throughout 2019, in 
particular in regards to pricing, access and 
affordability of medicines, which continues 
to be reflected in media sentiment and 
social media conversations. The decline in 
trust is not unique to Novo Nordisk, but is a 
trend across the pharma sector. Data were 
collected between June and September 
2019; a score between 70 and 80 is con-
sidered strong. The target is at least 80.

Environmental performance
Novo Nordisk has a bold and simple 
ambition: to have zero environmental 
impact. To get there we are adopting a 
circular mindset – designing products that 
can be recycled or re-used, reshaping our 
business practice to minimise consumption 
and eliminate waste, and working with 
suppliers who share our ambition. Our bold 
ambition is communicated through the 
new Circular for Zero environmental strate-
gy. We measure our progress based on use 
of resources, emissions and waste.
Resources 
In 2019, the energy consumption for op-
erations decreased slightly compared with 
2018. There is a continued focus on ener-
gy-saving projects within production, and 
projects implemented in 2019 are expected 
to result in annual savings of 72,000 GJ.  
Water consumption in production sites in 
2019 increased slightly by 2% compared 
with 2018. Three facilities in Algeria, Brazil 
and China are in areas with water stress 
or high seasonal variability. These sites 
accounted for 14% of the total water con-
sumption in 2019, and there is a continued 
focus on reducing water consumption 
across these sites.
As part of the new Circular for Zero 
strategy, procurement is collaborating with 
suppliers to reduce environmental impact 
across the value chain via a gradual shift to 
sustainably sourced materials. 
Novo Nordisk is also working to ensure ex-
isting and new products are fit for circulari-
ty, and, in 2019, a Circular Design Guideline 
was developed within R&D to reduce the 
environmental footprint of our devices.
Emissions 
In 2019, total emissions across operations 
and transportation were 306,000 tons CO
2
, 
which is a 10% increase compared to 2018, 
primarily due to a significant increase in 
emissions from product distribution. This was 
due to an increase in distributed volume, and 
the fact that there was more air freight than 
sea freight due to supply and market-driven 
challenges. In 2020, Novo Nordisk has focus 
on ensuring a shift to sea freight and to en-
sure efficient production planning to reduce 
emissions from product distribution.
Emissions from production remained stable 
compared to 2018. At the end of 2019, the 
conversion of Asnæs power plant in Kalund-
borg, Denmark was completed in collab-
oration with the energy company, Ørsted. 
This means that future heat and steam for 
our largest production site will come from 
sustainable biomass instead of fossil fuels.
With the use of bionatural gas and steam 
based on biomass in Denmark, as well 
as power from renewable sources across 
global production sites, it is expected that 
more than 75% of the total energy use for 
production sites will be based on renew-
able sources in 2020.
Emissions from global offices and labs 
decreased by 15,000 tons CO
2
 in 2019. As a 
part of the new Circular for Zero strategy, all 
offices and labs will source renewable power 
by 2030. In 2019, there was a significant re-
duction in CO
2
 emissions from the R&D site 
in Beijing, due to sourcing of wind power.
Emissions from company cars remained 
stable at 62,000 tons CO
2
 in 2019. In order 
to decrease emissions from company cars 
and encourage the global shift to electric 
vehicles, Novo Nordisk joined EV100 this 
year. This partnership means that Novo 
Nordisk commits to transitioning the entire 
fleet of approximately 8,000 vehicles to 
hybrid and electric vehicles by 2030. 
Emissions from business flights are estimat-
ed to be 65,000 tons CO
2
 in 2019, a small 
increase compared to 2018. In 2019, Novo 
Nordisk invested in 55 new, larger video 
conferencing systems and five immersive 
video systems to enhance the conferencing 
experience. In 2019, over 90 major events 
were hosted from Livestream, including 
updates from Executive Management.
An ambitious circular supplier program, 
'Suppliers for Zero', was initiated as part of 
the Circular for Zero strategy. Twelve key 
suppliers have enrolled in 2019 of which 
four have committed to achieving zero CO
2 
emissions.
Waste 
Compared to 2018, waste decreased by 
13% in 2019. This was due to a decreased 
amount of both ethanol waste and organic 
residues from the production of API in 
Kalundborg.
Overall, 93% of waste generated from 
production is recycled, used for biogas 
production or incinerated in waste-to-ener-
gy plants. In 2019, 1% of total waste was 
sent to landfill.
O
ne strategic focus of the Circular for Zero 
strategy is to investigate the end-of-life 
challenge of devices following patient use, 
for the materials can be recovered and 
re cycled into new products. 
Long-term environmental targets 
I
n 2019, 76% of power for production sites 
was sourced from renewable energy.  In 
2019, Novo Nordisk finalised an agre ement 
in the United States to have solar energy 
cover power consumption across all US op-
e
rations. This agreement is effective as of 
2020. With this solution, Novo Nordisk will 
achieve its target to source 100% renew-
able power at all production sites in 2020.
In 2019, total emissions across operations 
and transportation was 306,000 tons CO
2.
 
Emissions are expected to decrease signifi-
cantly in 2020 due to various re newable 
energy projects, including solar power 
across all US operations, wind power in 
Europe and green steam in Denmark. Emis-
sions from transportation are also expected 
to decrease due to a company car policy 
that encourages transition to hybrid and 
electric vehicles and through collaboration 
with EV100, (The Climate Group's global 
initiative for electrical vehicles). The target 
is to have zero emissions from operations 
and transportation by 2030 and it covers 
production sites, over 80 offices and labo-
ratories, company cars, business flights and 
product distribution and was approved by 
the Science Based Target Initiative.

Managing risks to 
protect value
For Novo Nordisk to continue to be a sustainable business, we must 
anticipate and adapt to changes in our markets to create new stra-
tegic opportunities. Managing the associated risks rigorously and 
systematically is key in order for us to create and protect value over 
the short, medium and long term.
Scenario and risk-thinking exercises 
are part of our strategic planning process. 
They include analyses of market dynamics 
as well as socioeconomic and political de-
velopments that present risks or opportuni-
ties for our business.
Balancing affordable care and  
commercial value
In the short and medium term, we zoom in 
on trends in the healthcare ecosystem we 
rely on. For example, in the diabetes care 
market, payers continue to put pressure on 
costs of insulin and are unwilling to pay a 
premium for incremental innovation.
For our business, the risks are reduced 
 profit from lower prices, and the damage 
to brand trust could be significant if we were 
seen to be profiteering from the situation.
The US healthcare system’s structural chal-
lenges continue to be a risk to our business 
as well. Affordable access to essential medi-
cines is a big issue for the approximately five 
percent of Americans who are uninsured. 
This will be front and centre in the 2020 
elections. Meanwhile, US market dynamics 
are forging new healthcare alliances that 
affect negotiations between payers and 
providers of medicines. Access to afford-
able care is not just an US issue. Globally, 
healthcare systems are struggling to provide 
quality care at a sustainable cost, while the 
burden of chronic disease keeps rising.
Digital disruption
New digital technologies in healthcare are 
offering more personalised treatment and 
better management of chronic diseases. 
This is an opportunity to deliver more value 
to our stakeholders and help patients live 
a life free from the limitations of their 
disease.
But the rise of digital healthcare brings 
risks of its own. New entrants and disrup-
tive competitors, including large tech play-
ers as well as new start-ups, will be able 
to leverage big data analytics to address 
some of the inefficiencies in the current 
healthcare systems. This will affect some 
of our markets, and we will have to act to 
avoid losing market share.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation in 
the sector should make us more productive 
and speed up our time-to-market. Today, 
we are running several AI and automation 
pilots to accelerate innovation and harvest 
efficiency gains. Highly agile technolo-
gy sector companies could enter with 
disruptive approaches to health care. AI is 
associated with issues such as unpredict-
ability of future uses. 
Moreover, new collaborations with per-
sonal healthcare players bring new risks 
– particularly around increased complexity,
shared commercial arrangements and data
regulation. The personal healthcare apps
need to be tested for quality and reliabil-
ity. If they do not work properly and give 
the correct guidance, they could present 
a health risk to the patients using our 
products. 
Facing up to environmental risks
Across all of these trends runs a growing 
and widely acknowledged concern for the 
global environment, particularly in relation 
to climate change.
We are preparing for the risks and oppor-
tunities which will arise from changing 
weather patterns, sea level rises and other 
climate impacts. As recommended by the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures, we are integrating climate 
change scenarios to identify short, medium 
and long-term risks within our production 
and supply chain to ensure a steady supply 
of medicine to patients.
Rigorous and robust risk management
A rigorous approach to enterprise risk man-
agement helps our management protect 
and enhance the value of our tangible and 
intangible assets.
We are continually exposed to risks 
throughout our value chain – from early 
discovery of new, promising molecules to 
the production and delivery of medicines 
to patients. Some risks are inherent in the 
pharmaceutical industry, such as delays or 
failures of potential new medicines in the 
R&D pipeline. Other risks such as supply 
disruptions and competitive threats are 
well-known to any manufacturing com-
pany with global production.
We will never compromise on product 
quality, patient safety and business ethics: 
these are front and centre of our enter-
prise-wide risk management set-up. We 
apply a two-way lens and assess risks to 
people as well as potential financial loss 
and reputational damage. 
Executive Management and the Board 
of Directors review a ‘heat map’ of our 
biggest risks biannually. This map is based 
on insights from management teams in all 
organisational areas and includes risks that 
could cause significant disruptions to the 
business over a three-year horizon. There is 
a more detailed overview of our key risks in 
the following overview.

Introducing Novo NordiskOur business

Novo Nordisk's key risks 
What is the risk?What is the impact?What actions are taken?
Delays or failure of products in pipeline
The development of a product candidate 
can take more than 10 years and may be 
delayed, or even abandoned, at substantial 
expense. The process involves non-clinical 
tests and clinical trials, commercial product 
planning and regulatory approval, including 
approval of production facilities.
Patients would not benefit from innovative 
treatments and Novo Nordisk’s future posi-
tion as a leader could be jeopardised if we 
were unable to bring innovative products 
to market. Any delays or failures of new 
products could have an adverse impact on 
sales, profits and market position.
Insights into patients’ unmet needs inform 
the selection of new product candidates. 
Clinical trials are run to demonstrate safety 
and efficacy. Assessments of commercial 
viability determine progress through stage 
gates. Consultations are held with regula-
tors to review clinical findings and obtain 
guidance on clinical programmes.
Supply disruptions
Failures or delays may occur at production 
sites or throughout the extensive global 
supply chain, relating to procurement of 
ingredients and components as well as 
distribution of products. This could be due 
to breakdowns or quality failures at com-
pany sites or at key suppliers’ production 
facilities.
If Novo Nordisk were prevented from 
supplying products to markets, pharmacies 
and hospitals could face product shortages, 
with potential implications for patients’ 
daily treatment needs.
Internal quality audits and annual inspec-
tions by regulatory authorities document 
GMP compliance, and alternative supply 
sites for critical raw materials and back-up 
facilities are in place for key production 
plants and safety inventories, to pre-
vent and respond to accidents or other 
disruptions to supplies. Global production 
reduces supply risks.
Competition and market developments
Governments and private payers take 
measures to limit spending on medicines 
by driving down prices, demanding higher 
rebates and restricting access to and 
reimbursement of new products. In some 
markets, political instability, conflict or 
weak enforcement of the rule of law may 
affect sales. At any time, established or 
new competitors may bring new  products 
to market or obtain label change for 
marketed products, leading to increased 
competition.
Patients would not have access to the 
clinical benefits of new products if Novo 
Nordisk were prevented from launching 
new products due to reimbursement 
restrictions and newer products could be 
niched for use in narrow sub-populations. 
Across all markets, product categories 
could face intensified competition and 
in these categories lower realised prices 
would be expected.
Clinical trial data demonstrate the added 
value of new products. Real-world evidence 
is introduced to show health economic 
benefits. Negotiations with payers aim to 
ensure patients’ access to the clinical bene-
fits of new products.
Compromises to product quality and patient safety
Product quality and patient safety may be 
compromised if, for example, a production 
facility is found to be in noncompliance, a 
product is not within specifications, or if 
side effects that were not detected in clini-
cal trials become apparent when a product 
is used for a longer period of time.
Patients’ health and lives could be put at 
risk and Novo Nordisk’s reputation and 
licence to operate could be damaged if 
regulatory compliance is not ensured.
A robust quality management system, 
improvement plans and systematic senior 
management reviews are in place. Author-
ity inspections and internal quality audits 
are conducted at production sites. When 
issues are found within the production pro-
cess of clinical or marketed products, root 
causes are identified and corrected and, if 
necessary, products are recalled.

What is the risk?What is the impact?What actions are taken?
IT security breaches
Disruption to IT systems, such as virus 
attacks, and breaches of data security, 
may happen across the global value chain, 
where reliable IT systems and infrastruc-
ture are critical for the company’s ability to 
operate effectively.
Patients’ or other individuals’ privacy could 
be compromised if confidential information 
were disclosed, and breaches of IT security 
could have a severe impact on Novo Nor-
disk’s ability to maintain operations and 
hence on its financial situation. In produc-
tion environments, for example, breaches 
of IT security could impact Novo Nordisk’s 
ability to produce and safeguard product 
quality.
IT security technologies and controls are 
in place to help prevent intruders from 
causing damage to systems and gaining 
access to critical data and systems. Con-
tinuity plans are in place in the event of 
non-availability of IT systems. Awareness 
campaigns, access controls and intrusion 
detection and prevention systems have 
been  implemented. Company-wide internal 
audits of IT security controls are conducted 
to detect and mitigate any breaches.
Currency impact and tax disputes
Exchange rate fluctuations, disputes 
with tax authorities and changes to tax 
legislation are external factors. Novo 
Nordisk’s foreign exchange risk is most 
significant in USD, CNY and JPY, while the 
EUR  exchange rate risk is regarded as low 
due to Denmark’s fixed-rate policy towards 
EUR.
Novo Nordisk’s cash flow, statement of 
comprehensive income and balance sheet 
can be impacted significantly by currency 
fluctuations. Changes to tax legislation or 
loss of major tax cases could result in signif-
icant tax adjustments and fines, and could 
lead to a higher-than-expected tax level for 
the company.
Expected future cash flows for selected 
currencies are hedged to mitigate short-
term impact on earnings and cash flow. An 
integrated treasury management system 
is in place. Applicable taxes are paid in 
jurisdictions where business activity gen-
erates profits. Multi-year advance pricing 
agreements with tax authorities have been 
negotiated for more than 60% of our sales 
in the US, China and Japan. Hedging activ-
ities and calculation of transfer pricing are 
subject to internal controls and audit.
Breach of legislation or ethical standards
In a tightly regulated industry, breach of 
legislation, industry codes or company 
policies may occur in connection with 
business interactions, such as with health-
care professionals, business partners or 
other stakeholders. Operations in complex 
socioeconomic and cultural contexts could 
present risks of non-compliance with 
Business Ethics standards including human 
rights and personal data protection.
Breaches of legislation or ethical standards 
could compromise the integrity, dignity and 
rights of the individuals involved and could 
cause damage to Novo Nordisk’s reputation 
and financial situation and could expose 
Novo Nordisk to investigations, criminal 
and civil sanctions and other penalties.
Compliance programmes address ad-
herence, such as the Business Ethics 
Compliance Framework, supported by 
due diligence, standard procedures and 
training to ensure compliance with laws, 
international standards and regulations 
and prevent breaches of standards, with 
legal defence where relevant. Compliance 
with business ethics standards is subject to 
internal audit. Action is taken immediately 
on  substantiated non-compliance. 
Loss of intellectual property rights
The validity of patents that are critical for 
protecting Novo Nordisk’s commercial 
products and candidates in the R&D pipe-
line may be challenged by competitors.
Loss of exclusivity for existing and pipeline 
products could impact Novo Nordisk’s 
market position, sales and profits.
Throughout the process of drafting, filing 
and prosecuting a patent application, 
internal controls are in place to minimise 
vulnerability to invalidity actions. Patents at 
high risk of invalidity challenge are proac-
tively identified to defend Novo Nordisk’s 
intellectual property rights.

Through open and proactive communication, the company aims to 
provide the basis for fair and efficient pricing of its shares.
Share capital and ownership
Novo Nordisk’s total share capital of DKK 
480,000,000 is divided into an A share 
capital of nominally DKK 107,487,200 
and a B share capital of nominally DKK 
372,512,800. Novo Nordisk’s B shares 
are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen and on 
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as 
American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Novo 
Nordisk’s A and B shares are calculated in 
units of DKK 0.20, resulting in 537 million 
A shares and 1,863 million B shares. Each 
A share carries 200 votes and each B share 
carries 20 votes.
The company’s A shares are not listed and 
are held by Novo Holdings A/S, a Danish 
public limited liability company wholly 
owned by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. 
The Foundation has a dual objective: to 
provide a stable basis for the commercial 
and research activities conducted by the 
companies within the Novo Group (of 
which Novo Nordisk A/S is the largest), 
and to support scientific and humanitarian 
purposes. According to the Articles of 
Association of the Foundation, the A shares 
cannot be divested. Special rights attached 
to A shares include pre-emptive subscrip-
tion rights in the event of an increase in the 
A share capital and pre-emptive purchase 
rights in the event of a sale of A shares, 
while B shares take priority for liquidation 
proceedings. A shares take priority for 
dividends below 0.5%, and B shares take 
priority for dividends between 0.5 and 5%. 
However, in practice, A shares and B shares 
receive the same amount of dividend per 
share. As of 31 December 2019, Novo 
Holdings A/S also held a B share capital of 
nominally DKK 27,152,800. Novo Holding 
A/S's total ownership is reflected in the 
following chart of ownership structure. 
There is no complete record of all share-
holders; however, based on available 
sources of information about the company’s 
shareholders, as of 31 December 2019 it is 
estimated that shares were geographically 
distributed as shown in the chart 'Geo-
graphical split'. As of 31 December 2019, 
the free float of listed B shares was 90.1% 
(of which approximately 11.9% are listed 
as ADRs), excluding the Novo Holdings 
A/S holding and Novo Nordisk’s holding of 
treasury shares which, as of 31 December 
2019, was DKK 36,780,840 nominally. For 
details about the share capital, see note 4.1.
Capital structure and dividend policy
Novo Nordisk’s Board of Directors and 
Executive Management consider that the 
current capital and share structure of Novo 
Nordisk serves the interests of the share-
holders and the company well, providing 
the strategic flexibility to pursue Novo 
Nordisk’s vision. Novo Nordisk’s capital 
structure strategy offers a good balance 
between long-term shareholder value cre-
ation and competitive shareholder return 
in the short term. Novo Nordisk’s guiding 
principle is that, after the funding of 
organic growth opportunities, investments 
and acquisitions, any excess capital should 
be returned to investors. The company’s 
dividend policy applies a pharmaceutical in-
dustry benchmark to ensure a competitive 
payout ratio for dividend payments, which 
are complemented by share repurchase 
programmes. The final dividend for 2018 
paid in March 2019 was equal to DKK 5.15 
per A and B share of DKK 0.20 as well 
as for ADRs. The total dividend for 2018 
was thus DKK 8.15 per A and B share of 
DKK 0.20, corresponding to a payout ratio 
of 50.6%, which is in line with the 2018 
pharma peer group average of 49.4%. In 
August 2019, an interim dividend was paid 
equalling DKK 3.00 per A and B share of 
DKK 0.20 as well as for ADRs. For 2019, 
the Board of Directors will propose a

final dividend of DKK 5.35 to be paid in 
March 2020, equivalent to a total dividend 
for 2019 of DKK 8.35 and a payout ratio of 
50.5%. The company expects to distribute 
an interim dividend in August 2020, and 
further information regarding such interim 
dividend will be announced in connection 
with the financial report for the first six 
months of 2020. Dividends are paid from 
distributable reserves. Share premium is a 
distributable reserve and any former share 
premium reserve has been fully distributed. 
Novo Nordisk does not pay a dividend on 
its holding of treasury shares.
Share repurchase programme for 
2019/2020
During the twelve-month period beginning 
1 February 2019, Novo Nordisk repur-
chased shares worth DKK 15 billion. The 
share repurchase programme has primarily 
been conducted in accordance with the 
safe harbour rules in the EU Market Abuse 
Regulation (MAR). For the next 12 months, 
Novo Nordisk has decided to implement 
a new share repurchase programme. 
The expected total repurchase value of B 
shares amounts to a cash value of up to 
DKK 17 billion. The total programme may 
be reduced in size if significant product 
in-    licensing or bolt-on acquisition oppor-
tunities arise during 2020. Novo Nordisk 
expects to conduct the majority of the new 
share repurchase programme according 
to the safe harbour rules in MAR. At the 
Annual General Meeting in March 2020, 
the Board of Directors will propose a 
further reduction in the company’s B share 
capital, corresponding to approximately 
2% of the total share capital, by cancel-
ling 50,000,000 treasury shares. After 
the implementation of the share capital 
reduction, Novo Nordisk’s share capital will 
amount to DKK 470,000,000 divided into 
A share capital of DKK 107,487,200 and B 
share capital of DKK 362,512,800.
Share price development
Novo Nordisk’s share price increased by 
29.8% between its 2018 close of DKK 
297.9 and the 31 December 2019 close 
of DKK 386.65. For comparison purposes, 
the Danish OMXC25 stock index increased 
by 26% and the pharma peer group 
increased by 13% during 2019. The total 
market value of Novo Nordisk’s A and B 
shares, excluding treasury shares, was 
DKK 909,178,012,657 as of 31 December 
2019. •

The Board of Directors of Novo Nordisk focuses on good gover-
nance practices. In 2019, one new board member was appointed at 
the Annual General Meeting. Two members of Executive Manage-
ment left Novo Nordisk after more than 20 years with the company 
and two new members of Executive Management were appointed.
Governance structure
Shareholders
The shareholders of Novo Nordisk have 
ultimate authority over the company and 
exercise their right to make decisions at 
general meetings. At the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting, shareholders approve the 
annual report and any amendments to 
the company’s Articles of Association. 
Shareholders also elect board members and 
the independent auditor. Resolutions can 
generally be passed by a simple majority. 
However, resolutions to amend the Articles 
of Association require two-thirds of the 
votes cast and capital represented, unless 
other adoption requirements are imposed 
by the Danish Companies Act.
Novo Holdings A/S holds the majority 
of votes at general meetings. However, 
all strategic and operational matters are 
 decided solely by the Board of Directors 
and Executive Management. Read more 
about the ownership structure of Novo 
Nordisk in 'Shares and capital structure'.
Board of Directors
Novo Nordisk has a two-tier management 
structure consisting of the Board of Direc-
tors and Executive Management. The two 
bodies are separate, and no one serves as a 
member of both.
The Board of Directors supervises Executive 
Management, determines the company’s 
overall strategy and follows up on its 
implementation, the performance, ensures 
adequate management and organisation 
and, as such, actively contributes to devel-
oping the company as a focused, sustain-
able, global pharmaceutical company. 
The Board of Directors may also distribute 
extraordinary dividends, issue new shares 
or repurchase shares in accordance with 
authorisations granted by the sharehold-
ers at the Annual General Meeting and 
recorded in the meeting minutes available 
at novonordisk.com/about_us.
Shareholder-elected board members serve 
for a one-year term and may be re-elected. 
Board members must retire at the first An-
nual General Meeting after reaching the age 
of 70. One board member is a member of 
the Board of Directors of Novo Holdings A/S, 
and one board member is chief executive 
officer of Novo Holdings A/S and may be 
regarded as representing the interests of the 
controlling shareholder, while seven of the 
nine shareholder-elected board members 
are independent as defined by the Danish 
Corporate Governance Recommendations.
Under Danish law, employees in Denmark 
may elect a number of board members 
equalling half of the shareholder-elected 
board members. Board members elected by 
employees serve for a statutory four-year 
term and have the same rights, duties 
and responsibilities as shareholder-elected 
board members. The employee-elected 
board members are up for election again 
in 2022. Read more about the members of 
the Board of Directors and at novonordisk.

Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2019
Our businessConsolidated statementsIntroducing Novo NordiskGovernance

As of 31 December 2019, the Board of 
Directors consisted of 13 members, nine of 
whom were elected by shareholders and 
four of whom were elected by employees 
based in Denmark. The Board of  Directors 
met eight times during 2019. At the 
Annual General Meeting in March 2019, 
Laurence Debroux was elected as new 
member of the Board of Directors.
Nomination, self-evaluation and  
diversity
A proposal for election or re-election of 
shareholder-elected board members is 
presented by the Nomination Committee 
to the Board of Directors. When recom-
mending candidates to be nominated by 
the Board, the Nomination Committee 
considers factors such as the balance 
between renewal and continuity, the 
desired competences and experience, the 
performance of the individual Board mem-
bers, the ambition for diversity as well as 
independence considerations.
To support continued fulfilment of the 
Novo Nordisk Way, in the Board com-
petence profile the Board of Directors 
has determined that the Board members 
should possess integrity, accountability, 
fairness, financial literacy, commitment 
and desire for innovation. Additionally, the 
following competences and experience 
should be represented on the Board: global 
business management, strategic operations 
and governance, healthcare industry and 
market access, research and development, 
technology and digitalisation, M&A and 
external innovation sourcing, people lead-
ership and change management as well as 
finance and accounting, cf. the biographies 
of Board members in the overview 'Board 
of Directors'. The competence profile, 
which includes the nomination criteria, is 
available at novonordisk.com/about_us.
The Board of Directors conducts a self-eval-
uation every year. The self-evaluation 
includes all members of the Board and Ex-
ecutive Management. The chair has overall 
responsibility for conducting the self-eval-
uation. The self-evaluation is facilitated 
every third year by external consultants, 
who interview all members of the Board of 
Directors and Executive Management. For 
the subsequent two years, the self-evalu-
ation is facilitated by the secretary of the 
Nomination Committee based on written 
questionnaires. The process evaluates topics 
such as board dynamics, board agenda 
and discussions, strategy, culture, exec-
utive succession, board composition and 
succession, potential over-boarding and 
training as well as the performance of the 
Chairmanship and the board committees. 
In addition, each member of the Board 
of Directors and Executive Management 
is provided with feedback from all other 
board members and executives on their 
individual  performance.
In 2019, the Board evaluation was facili-
tated internally and, in general, revealed 
good performance by the Board and 
good collaboration between the Board 
and Executive Management. The process 
also resulted in continued focus on the 
implementation of the R&D strategy, on 
commercial execution and on being a 
sustainable company.
T
o ensure that discussions include multiple 
perspectives representing the complex, 
global pharmaceutical environment, the 
Board of Directors aspires to be diverse in 
gender and nationality.
In 2016, the Board of Directors adjusted its 
diversity ambition and set new targets with 
the aim of consisting, by 2020, of at least 
two shareholder-elected board members 
with Nordic nationality and at least two 
shareholder-elected board members with a 
nationality other than Nordic – and at least 
three shareholder-elected board members 
of each gender.
As of 31 December 2019, three 
shareholder- elected board members were 
female and six were male, while seven 
of the nine shareholder-elected board 
members were non-Nordic and two were 
Nordic. The company thus fulfilled its 
nationality ambition and its gender ambi-
tion. The Board of Directors will revisit its 
diversity ambition in 2020 and, if needed, 
adjust the numbers and parameters which 
are currently fulfilled.
In accordance with section 99b of the 
 Danish Financial Statements Act, Novo 
Nordisk discloses current performance 
on diversity in the 'Social performance' 
section. Novo Nordisk’s diversity policy is 
available at novonordisk.com.
Board committees
Chairmanship
The Chairmanship consists of the chair and 
the vice chair, both of whom are elected 
directly by the shareholders at the general 
meetings. At the Annual General Meeting 
in 2019, Helge Lund was re-elected as chair 
and Jeppe Christiansen was re-elected as 
vice chair. The Chairmanship assists the 
Board of Directors in the planning of Board 
meetings, employment of Executive Man-
agement and other assignments as decided 
by the Board. 
In 2019, the Chairmanship particularly 
discussed commercial execution within 
the therapy areas and in different mar-
kets, partnering and acquisition to access 
external innovation as well as talent and 
leadership development, supervising the 
changes in Executive Management and 
development of the company culture.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee assists the Board 
of Directors with oversight of the exter-
nal  auditors, the internal audit function, 
handling hotline complaints, financial, 
social and environmental reporting, 
business ethics compliance, information 
security, insurance coverage, special theme 
reviews and other tasks on an ad hoc basis, 
as specifically decided by the Board. All 
members have relevant industry expertise. 
For independence see table on meeting 
participation in 2019.
The Audit Committee is appointed by the 
Board and consists of:
•Liz Hewitt (chair; financial expert)
•Laurence Debroux (financial expert)
•Andreas Fibig
•Sylvie Grégoire
•Stig Strøbæk
In 2019, the Audit Committee focused 
particularly on reviewing and discussing 
work performed by internal and external 
auditors and held focused sessions on risks 
and internal controls in key areas such as 
North America Operations, Product Supply 
and International Operations. The Audit 
Committee also discussed key accounting 
policies and estimates, including provi-
sions for sales rebates, indirect production 
costs and ongoing tax and legal cases. 
The Audit Committee also reviewed and 
discussed the status of Information Security 
and Business Ethics Compliance within 
Novo Nordisk. Finally, the Audit Committee 
recommended a preferred external auditor 
which is to be selected by the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting in 2021.

of board members, Board committees and 
Executive Management.
The Remuneration Committee is appointed 
by the Board and consists of:
•Jeppe Christiansen (chair)
•Brian Daniels
•Liz Hewitt
•Anne Marie Kverneland
In 2019, the Remuneration Committee fo-
cused particularly on conducting a general

ing proposing changes to the base salary, 
the pension, the short-term cash-based 
incentive programme, the long-term share-
based incentive programme, the sharehold-
ing requirement, etc., and on developing of 
a new Remuneration Policy to be approved 
by the Annual General Meeting and a new 
separate Remuneration Report to be pre-
sented to the Annual General Meeting.

See the Corporate Governance Report or 
novonordisk.com/about_us for a more de-
tailed description of the Board committees, 
their charters, details on members and full 
reports on the Board committees’ activities 
in 2019.
Executive Management
Executive Management is responsible 
for overall day-to-day management, the 
organisation of the company, allocation of 
resources, determination and implemen-
tation of strategies and policies, direction 
setting, and ensuring timely reporting and 
provision of information to the Board of 
Directors and Novo Nordisk’s stakeholders. 
Executive Management meets at least once 
a month. The Board of Directors appoints 
members of Executive Management and 
determines their remuneration. The Chair-
manship reviews the performance of the 
executives.
T
o ensure the organisational implementa-
tion of the strategy, Executive Management 
has established a Management Board 
consisting of the chief executive officer, 
executive vice presidents and senior vice 
presidents.
As of 31 December 2019, Executive 
Management consisted of nine members 
including the chief executive officer. As of 
April 2019, Jesper Brandgaard retired from 
Novo Nordisk and Ludovic Helfgott was 
appointed executive vice president, head of 
Biopharm. As of August 2019,  Lars Green 
resigned from Novo Nordisk and Monique 
Carter was appointed executive vice presi-
dent, head of People & Organisation.
The three executives who are based outside 
Denmark and who have responsibility for 
Biopharm, International Operations and 
North America Operations, respectively, 
are not registered as executives with the 
Danish Business Authority.
Remuneration
Novo Nordisk’s Remuneration Principles 
provide the framework for the remuner-
ation of the Board and Executive Man-
agement. The Remuneration Principles 
were most recently changed in March 
2019, where the Annual General Meeting 
approved amendments in order to reflect 
the fact that the Research & Development 
Committee had become a permanent 
Board committee and in order to  ensure 
that Novo Nordisk is able to reclaim 
incorrect pay-outs of incentives based on a 
misstatement of data regardless of whether 
this originates due to wilful misconduct or 
gross negligence. Moreover, the Annual 
General Meeting approved the denomi-
nation of travel allowance in DKK instead 
of EUR. These principles are available at 
novonordisk.com/about-novo-nordisk/cor-
porate-governance/remuneration.html.
Novo Nordisk has prepared a separate 
Remuneration Report that describes the 
remuneration awarded or due during 2019 
to the members of the Board and the Exec-
utive Management of Novo Nordisk A/S as 
registered with the Danish Business Author-
ity. This report also includes a description of 
key developments in remuneration in 2019, 
the actual remuneration of board members 
and executives, an overview of remuner-
ation awarded during the previous five

Assurance 
The company’s financial reporting and 
the internal controls of financial reporting 
processes are audited by an independent 
audit firm elected at the Annual General 
Meeting. As part of Novo Nordisk’s com-
mitment to its social and environmental

Corporate Governance report
responsibility, the company voluntarily 
includes an assurance report for social 
and environmental reporting in the annual 
report. The assurance provider reviews 
whether the social and environmental per-
formance information covers aspects that 
are deemed to be material and verifies the 
internal control processes for the informa-
tion reported.
Novo Nordisk’s internal audit function 
provides independent and objective assur-
ance, primarily within internal control of 
financial processes, IT security and business 
ethics. To ensure that the internal financial 
audit function operates independently of 
Executive Management, its charter, audit 
plan and budget are approved by the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee must 
approve the appointment, remuneration 
and dismissal of the head of the internal 
audit function.
Other types of assurance activity – quality 
audits and values audits, known as facili-
tations – help to ensure that the company 
adheres to high quality standards and op-
erates in accordance with the Novo Nordisk 
Way. Read more about the Novo Nordisk 
Way in 'Leading a sustainable business'.
Compliance with corporate 
governance codes
Novo Nordisk’s B shares are listed on 
Nasdaq Copenhagen and on the New York 
Stock Exchange (NYSE) as American Depos-
itory Receipts (ADRs).
Today, Novo Nordisk adheres to all Danish 
Corporate Governance Recommendations 
designated by Nasdaq Copenhagen except 
the following five recommendations:
3.3.2  Disclosure of additional information 
about the Board members: informa-
tion on matters such as numbers of 
shares owned and changes during 
the year is disclosed in the Remuner-
ation Report for 2019 and not in the 
management commentary.
3.4.2  Independence of Board committees: 
the majority of the members of the 
Nomination Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee are not 
independent.
3.4.6  Tasks of the Nomination Committee: 
responsibility for succession manage-
ment and recommending candidates 
for the Executive Management re-
sides with the Chairmanship and not 
with the Nomination Committee.
3.4.7  Tasks of the Remuneration Commit-
tee: responsibility for the remunera-
tion policy applicable to employees 
in general resides with Executive 
Management and not with the Re-
muneration Committee.
4.1.5  Termination payments: one executive 
employment contract entered into 
before 2008 allow for severance pay-
ments of more than 24 months’ fixed 
base salary plus pension contribu-
tion, and thus the total value of the 
remuneration relating to the notice 
period and of the severance payment 
exceeds two years of remuneration.
Novo Nordisk complies with the corporate 
governance standards of NYSE applicable 
to foreign listed private issuers. A summa-
ry of the significant ways in which Novo 
Nordisk’s corporate governance practices 
differ from the NYSE corporate governance 
listing standards can be found in the Statu-
tory Corporate Governance Report.
The Statutory Corporate Governance 
Report, in accordance with section 107b 
of the Danish Financial Statements Act, 
the applicable corporate governance codes 
for each stock exchange and an overview 
of Novo Nordisk’s compliance with and 
explanations for all applicable Nasdaq and 
NYSE Corporate Governance recommenda-
tions, are all available at novonordisk.com/
about-novo-nordisk/corporate-governance/
Recommendations-and-practices.html
Disclosure regarding change 
of control
The EU Takeover Bids Directive, as partially 
implemented by the Danish Financial State-
ments Act, requires listed companies to 
disclose information that may be of interest 
to the market and potential take-over bid-
ders, in particular in relation to disclosure 
of change-of-control provisions.
Novo Nordisk discloses that the Group has 
one significant agreement with a US payer 
which takes effect, alters or terminates 
upon a change of control of the Group. If 
effected, a takeover could – at the discre-
tion of the relevant counterparty – lead to 
the termination of such agreement. Given 
the ownership structure of Novo Nordisk, 
the risk is considered to be remote.
In relation to Executive Management, 
the current employment contracts allow 
severance payments of up to 36 months' 
fixed base salary plus pension contributions 
in the event of a merger, acquisition or 
takeover of Novo Nordisk.
For information about the ownership 
structure of Novo Nordisk, see 'Shares and 
capital structure'.

Section 1
Basis of preparation
The key accounting estimates identified are those that have a significant risk of 
resulting in a material adjustment to the measurement of assets and liabilities 
in the following reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical 
experience and various other assumptions that are held to be reasonable under 
the circumstances. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. If necessary, changes are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised. Management considers the key accounting estimates to be 
reasonable and appropriate based on currently available information. The actual 
amounts may differ from the amounts estimated as more detailed information 
becomes available.
In addition, Management makes judgements and estimates in the process of 
applying the entity’s accounting policies, for example regarding recognition and 
measurement of deferred income tax assets or the classification of transactions.
Management regards those listed below as the key accounting estimates and 
judgements used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Please refer to the specific notes for further information on the key accounting 
estimates and judgements as well as assumptions applied.

Applying materiality
The consolidated financial statements are a result of processing large numbers of 
transactions and aggregating those transactions into classes according to their 
nature or function. The transactions are presented in classes of similar items in 
the consolidated financial statements. If a line item is not individually material, 
it is aggregated with other items of a similar nature in the consolidated financial 
statements or in the notes.
There are substantial disclosure requirements throughout IFRS. Management 
provides specific disclosures required by IFRS unless the information is not appli-
cable or is considered immaterial to the economic decision-making of the users of 
these financial statements.
1.1 Principal accounting policies and key accounting estimates
The consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and in accordance 
with IFRS as endorsed by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial 
Statements Act. All entities in the Novo Nordisk Group follow the same Group 
accounting policies.
Measurement basis
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost 
basis except for derivative financial instruments, equity investments and trade 
receivables in a factoring portfolio, which are measured at fair value.
Except for the changes described in note 1.2, the principal accounting policies set 
out below have been applied consistently in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements for all the years presented.
Principal accounting policies
Novo Nordisk’s accounting policies are described in each of the individual notes to 
the consolidated financial statements. Accounting policies listed in the table below 
are regarded as the principal accounting policies applied by the Management.
Key accounting estimates and judgements
The use of reasonable estimates and judgements is an essential part of the prepa-
ration of the consolidated financial statements. Given the uncertainties inherent 
in Novo Nordisk’s business activities, Management must make certain estimates 
regarding valuation and judgements on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
net sales, expenses and related disclosures.

1.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
Adoption of new or amended IFRSs
Management has assessed the impact of new or amended and revised accounting 
standards and interpretations (IFRSs) issued by the IASB and IFRSs endorsed by the 
European Union.
IFRS 16 'Leases'
As of 1 January 2019 Novo Nordisk applied IFRS 16 'Leases' for the first time. 
The Group has implemented IFRS 16 'Leases' using the modified retrospective 
approach. 
Under this method, the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is 
recognised at 1 January 2019. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities have been 
recognised for those leases previously classified as operating leases, except for 
short-term leases and leases of low value assets. The right-of-use assets have been 
recognised based on the amount equal to the lease liabilities, adjusted for any 
related prepaid and accrued lease payments previously recognised. Lease liabilities 
are recognised based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, 
discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as of 1 January 2019. The 
comparative information has not been restated.
Impact from IFRS 16 as of 1 January 2019:
DKK million

2019
Property, plant and equipment3,778
Prepayments(5)
Borrowings (non-current)3,330
Borrowings (current)658
Other liabilities(215)
Net assets—
On transition to IFRS 16, the Group recognised an additional DKK 3,778 million of 
right-of-use assets and DKK 3,988 million of lease liabilities.
The change in policy has had an insignificant impact on the income statement. 
In the cash flow statement the principal repayment of lease liabilities is presented 
in 'net cash used in financing activities', whereas the full lease payment under 
previous policies was presented in 'net cash generated from operating activities'. 
The change in policy has had no impact on free cash flow due to a change in 
definition, as described in non-IFRS financial measures. Refer to note 3.3 for the 
new accounting policies.
The following recognition exemptions and practical expedients were applied on 
transition:
•  Applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics
•    Excluded initial direct costs from measuring the right-of-use asset at the date of 
initial application
•    Used hindsight when determining the lease term if the contract contains option 
to extend or terminate
•    Exempted short-term lease contracts with a remaining duration of 12 months 
or less as at 1 January 2019

Lease liability recognised on transition3,988
On transition to IFRS 16, Novo Nordisk recognised lease liabilities in relation to 
leases which had previously been classified as operating leases in accordance 
with IAS 17. The lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the future 
discounted lease payments using Novo Nordisk's incremental borrowing rate at 
1 January 2019. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied on 
transition to IFRS 16 was 2.95%.
Other new interpretations effective 1 January 2019
It is assessed that application of other new interpretations effective on 1 January 
2019 has not had a material impact on the Consolidated financial statements in 
2019. Furthermore, Management does not anticipate any significant impact on 
future periods from the adoption of these new interpretations.
Adoption of new or amended IFRSs in prior periods 
As of 1 January 2018 Novo Nordisk applied IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and IFRS 
15 'Revenue from contracts with customers' for the first time. The impact of the 
implementation of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 was immaterial in relation to recognition 
and measurement.
1.3 General accounting policies
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the 
parent company Novo Nordisk A/S and entities controlled by Novo Nordisk A/S. 
Control exists when Novo Nordisk has effective power over the entity and has the 
right to variable returns from the entity.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the financial statements of 
subsidiaries in line with the Novo Nordisk Group's accounting policies. All intra-
Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full when 
consolidated.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in 
the Consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition and up 
to the effective date of disposal.
Translation of foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of Novo Nordisk's entities are measured 
using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity oper-
ates (functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
Danish kroner (DKK), which is also the functional and presentation currency of the 
parent company.
Translation of transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the 
exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates. Foreign exchange gains and 
losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation 
at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the 
income statement.
Foreign currency differences arising from the translation of effective qualifying 
cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Translation of Group companies
Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into DKK at the 
exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period for balance sheet 
items, and at average exchange rates for income statement items. 
All effects of exchange rate adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive 
income, i.e.:
•   The translation of foreign subsidiaries’ net assets at the beginning of the year to 
the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period.
•   The translation of foreign subsidiaries’ statements of comprehensive income at 
average to year-end exchange rates.

Section 2
Results for the year
2.1 Net sales and rebates
Accounting policies
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when Novo Nordisk has transferred 
control of products sold to the buyer and it is probable that Novo Nordisk will 
collect the consideration to which it is entitled for transferring the products. 
Control of the products is transferred at a point in time, typically on delivery.
The amount of sales to be recognised is based on the consideration Novo Nordisk 
expects to receive in exchange for its goods. When sales are recognised, Novo 
Nordisk also records estimates for a variety of sales deductions, including product 
returns as well as rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, 
health insurance companies, managed healthcare organisations and retail 
customers. Sales deductions are recognised as a reduction of gross sales to arrive 
at net sales, by assessing the expected value of the sales deductions (variable 
consideration). Where contracts contain customer acceptance criteria, Novo 
Nordisk recognises sales when the acceptance criteria are satisfied.
In some markets, Novo Nordisk sells products on a sale-or-return basis. 
Where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of future 
returns, estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in sales.
Where shipments of new products are made on a sale-or-return basis, without 
sufficient historical experience for estimating sales returns, revenue is recorded 
based on estimated demand and acceptance rates for well-established products 
with similar market characteristics. If similar market characteristics do not exist, 
revenue is recorded when there is evidence of consumption or when the right of 
return has expired. 
Key accounting estimates of sales deductions and provisions for sales 
rebates
Sales deductions are estimated and provided for at the time the related sales are 
recorded. These estimates of unsettled rebate, discount and product return obliga-
tions require use of significant judgement, as not all conditions are known at the 
time of sale, for example total sales volume to a given customer.
The estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual obligations and histor-
ical experience. Provisions are calculated on the basis of a percentage of sales 
for each product as defined by the contracts with the various customer groups. 
Provisions for sales rebates are adjusted to actual amounts as rebates, discounts 
and returns are processed.
Novo Nordisk considers the provisions established for sales rebates to be reason-
able and appropriate based on currently available information. However, the 
actual amount of rebates and discounts may differ from the amounts estimated by 
Management as more detailed information becomes available.

Sales discounts and sales rebates are predominantly issued in the US. As such, 
rebates amount to 71% of gross sales in the US (68% in 2018 and 64% in 2017). 
Novo Nordisk sales are impacted by exchange rate changes. For developments in 
key currencies refer to note 4.3. 
Pricing mechanisms in the US market
In the US, sales rebates are paid in connection with public healthcare insurance 
programmes, namely Medicare and Medicaid, as well as rebates to pharmacy 
benefit managers (PBMs) and managed healthcare plans. Key customers in the US 
include private payers, PBMs and government payers. PBMs and managed health-
care plans play a role in negotiating price concessions with drug manufacturers for 
both the commercial and government channels, and determine which drugs are 
covered on their formularies (or 'preferred drug lists').
US Managed Care and Medicare
For Managed Care and Medicare, rebates are offered to a number of PBMs 
and managed healthcare plans. These rebate programmes allow the customer 
to receive a rebate after attaining certain performance parameters relating to 
formulary status or pre-established market shares thresholds. Rebates are esti-
mated according to the specific terms in each agreement, historical experience, 
anticipated channel mix, growth rates and market share information. Novo 
Nordisk adjusts the provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. 
Managed Care and Medicare rebates are generally settled around 100 days from 
the transaction date.
US wholesaler charge-backs
Wholesaler charge-backs relate to contractual arrangements between Novo 
Nordisk and indirect customers in the US whereby products are sold at contract 
prices lower than the list price originally charged to wholesalers. A wholesaler 
charge-back represents the difference between the invoice price to the wholesaler 
and the indirect customer’s contract price. Accruals are calculated for estimated 
charge-backs using a combination of factors such as historical experience, current 
wholesaler inventory levels, contract terms and the value of claims received but 
not yet processed. Wholesaler charge-backs are generally settled within 30 days of 
the liability being incurred.
US Medicaid rebates
Medicaid is a government insurance programme. Medicaid rebates have been 
estimated using a combination of historical experience, product and population 
growth, price increases, and the impact of contracting strategies. The calculation 
also involves interpretation of relevant regulations that are subject to changes in 
interpretative guidance from government authorities. Novo Nordisk adjusts the 
provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. Medicaid rebates are 
generally settled around 150 days from the transaction date.
Other US discounts and sales returns
Other discounts are provided to wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, etc. They 
are usually linked to sales volume or provided as cash discounts. Accruals are 
calculated based on historical data and recorded as a reduction in gross sales at 
the time the related sales are recorded. Sales returns are related to damaged or 
expired products.
Arrangements with certain healthcare providers may require Novo Nordisk to 
make refunds to the healthcare providers if anticipated treatment outcomes do 
not meet predefined targets.

Unsettled rebates are recognised as Provisions when the timing or amount 
is uncertain (note 3.7). Where absolute amounts are known, the rebates are 
recognised as other liabilities. Wholesaler charge-backs are netted against trade 
receivable balances. Provisions for sales rebates thus includes US Managed Care, 
Medicare, Medicaid and other minor US rebate types, as well as rebates in a 
number of European countries and Canada.

2.2 Segment information
Accounting policies
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting 
provided to Executive Management and the Board of Directors. We consider 
Executive Management to be the operating decision-making body, as all significant 
decisions regarding business development and direction are taken in this forum.
Business segments
Novo Nordisk operates in two business segments based on therapies: Diabetes and 
Obesity care and Biopharm, representing the entirety of the Group's operations.
The segments include research, development, manufacturing and marketing of 
products within the following areas: 
-   Diabetes and Obesity care: insulin, GLP-1 and related delivery systems, oral anti-
diabetic products (OAD), obesity and other serious chronic diseases.
- Biopharm: haemophilia, growth disorders and hormone replacement therapy.
Segment performance is evaluated on the basis of operating profit consistent with 
the Consolidated financial statements. Financial income and expenses and income 
taxes are managed at Group level and are not allocated to business segments. 
There are no sales or other transactions between the business segments. Costs 
have been split between business segments according to a specific allocation. In 
addition, a small number of corporate overhead costs are allocated systematically 
between the segments. Other operating income has been allocated to the two 
segments based on the same principle. Segment assets comprise the assets that 
are applied directly to the activities of the segment, including intangible assets, 
property, plant and equipment, inventories, trade receivables and other receivables 
and prepayments.

Net sales disclosures 
Sales to external customers attributed to the US are collectively the most material 
to the Group. The US and Mainland China are the only territories where sales 
contribute 10% or more of total net sales.
In 2019, Novo Nordisk had three major wholesalers distributing products, repre-
senting 19%, 14% and 12% respectively of total net sales (20%, 13% and 13% 
in 2018 and 21%, 13% and 12% in 2017). Sales to these three wholesalers are 
within both Diabetes and Obesity care and Biopharm.
Net sales to be recognised from fulfilling existing customer contracts containing 
fixed or minimum sales volumes, with an original term greater than 12 months, is 
expected to be DKK 544 million within 12 months (2018: DKK 767 million) and 
DKK 32 million thereafter (2018: DKK 742 million).  
Net sales will be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations. Novo Nordisk has an 
accounting policy to recognise the income statement impact of foreign currency 
hedging within financial items. Please refer to notes 4.3, 4.4 and 4.9 for more

2.2 Segment information (continued)
Geographical areas 
Novo Nordisk operates in two main commercial units:
 
• International Operations
	◦   Region Europe: the EU, EFTA, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, 
     Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo
	◦   Region AAMEO: countries in Africa, Asia, Middle East & Oceania
	◦   Region China: Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong
	◦   Region Japan & Korea: Japan and South Korea
	◦   Region Latin America: countries in South America, Central America  
        and    Mexico
• North America Operations (the US and Canada)
Sales are attributed to geographical regions according to the location of the 
customer. Allocation of property, plant and equipment, trade receivables, allow-
ance for trade receivables and total assets is based on the location of the assets.
The country of domicile is Denmark, which is part of Region Europe. Denmark 
is immaterial to Novo Nordisk’s activities in terms of geographical size and the 
operational business segments. 99.7% of total sales are realised outside Denmark. 
Of total property, plant and equipment, DKK 25,175 million is located in Denmark, 
where the Group's main production, filling, packaging, moulding and assembly 
facilities are located.

2.3 Research and development costs
Accounting policies
Novo Nordisk’s research and development is mainly focused on: 
•   Insulins, GLP-1s and other therapeutic new antidiabetic drugs for diabetes 
treatment.
•   GLP-1s, combinations and new modes of action for Obesity care.
• Blood-clotting factors and new modes of action for haemophilia treatment.
•   Human growth hormone for treatment of growth disorders.
•   New modes of action including GLP-1 and stem cells for treatment of NASH, 
cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and Parkinson's disease, among 
others.
The research activities mainly utilise biotechnological methods based on advanced 
protein chemistry and protein engineering. These methods have played a key role 
in the development of the production technology used to manufacture insulin, 
GLP-1, recombinant blood-clotting factors and human growth hormone.
Novo Nordisk expenses all research costs. In line with industry practice, internal 
and subcontracted development costs are also expensed as they are incurred, due 
to significant regulatory uncertainties and other uncertainties inherent in the devel-
opment of new products. This means that they do not qualify for capitalisation 
as intangible assets until marketing approval by a regulatory authority is obtained 
or considered highly probable. Costs for post-approval activities that are required 
by authorities as a condition for obtaining regulatory approval are recognised as 
research and development costs. 
Research and development activities are carried out by Novo Nordisk’s research and 
development centres, mainly in Denmark, the US, the UK and China. Research and 
development trials are carried out all over the world. Novo Nordisk also enters into 
partnerships and licence agreements.
Research and development costs primarily comprise employee costs, and internal 
and external costs related to execution of studies, including manufacturing costs 
and facility costs of the research centres. The costs also comprise amortisation, 
depreciation and impairment losses related to software and property, plant and 
equipment used in the research and development activities. Impairment losses 
recognised on intangible assets not yet available for use related to research and 
development projects are presented in research and development costs.

Consolidated Financial Statements51

2.3 Research and development costs (continued)
Certain research and development activities are recognised outside research and 
development costs:
•   Royalty expenses paid to partners after regulatory approval are expensed as cost 
of goods sold.
•   Royalty income received from partners is recognised as part of other operating 
income, net.
•   Contractual research and development obligations to be paid in the future are 
disclosed separately as commitments in note 5.2.

Accounting policies
Wages, salaries, social security contributions, annual leave and sick leave, 
bonuses and non-monetary benefits are recognised in the year in which the 
associated services are rendered by employees of Novo Nordisk. Where Novo 
Nordisk provides long-term employee benefits, the costs are accrued to match the 
rendering of the services by the employees concerned.

2.6 Income taxes and deferred income taxes
Income taxes
Accounting policies
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax as well as 
interest on tax cases ongoing or settled during the year. It also includes adjust-
ments to previous years and changes in provisions for uncertain tax positions. Tax 
is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.
Provisions for ongoing tax disputes are included as part of deferred tax assets, tax 
receivables and tax payables.
Management judgement regarding recognition of deferred income tax 
assets and provisions for uncertain tax positions
Novo Nordisk is subject to income taxes around the world. Significant judgement 
and estimates are required in determining the worldwide accrual for income taxes, 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities and provisions for uncertain tax positions.
Novo Nordisk recognises deferred income tax assets if it is probable that sufficient 
taxable income will be available in the future, against which the temporary differ-
ences and unused tax losses can be utilised. 
Management has considered future taxable income and applied its judgement in 
assessing whether deferred income tax assets should be recognised.
In the course of conducting business globally, tax and transfer pricing disputes 
with tax authorities may occur. Management judgement is applied to assess the 
possible outcome of such disputes. The 'most probable outcome' method is 
applied when making provisions for uncertain tax positions, and Novo Nordisk 
considers the provisions made to be adequate. However, the actual obligation may 
deviate and depends on the result of litigation and settlements with the relevant 
tax authorities.
Swiss tax reform
In 2019, a tax reform was passed in Switzerland. The tax reform has a minor positive 
impact on the effective tax rate in 2019, driven by a non-recurring increase to 
deferred tax assets.

2.5 Other operating income, net
Accounting policies
Other operating income, net, comprises licence income and income of a 
secondary nature in relation to the main activities of Novo Nordisk. Licence income 
from royalties on future net sales is recognised as the underlying customers' sale 
occurs and from sales milestones once the contingent sale milestone is achieved 
in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreement. Income from the transfer 
of the right to use intellectual property may contain development or regulatory 
milestones (variable consideration) on which the income is recognised when 
the significant uncertainties in achieving the milestones are resolved, due to 
the significant uncertainties inherent in the development of pharmaceutical 
products.  
Operating profit from the wholly owned subsidiary NNE A/S, not related to 
Novo Nordisk’s main activities, is recognised as other operating income. Other 
operating income also includes income from sale of intellectual property rights.

The total tax value of unrecognised tax loss carry-forwards amounts to DKK 144 million in 2019 (DKK 90 million in 2018).
In general, the Danish tax rules related to dividends from group companies 
provide exemption from tax for most repatriated profits. A provision for with-
holding tax is only recognised if a concrete distribution of dividends is planned. 
The unrecognised potential withholding tax amounts to DKK 315 million for 2019 
(DKK 367 million in 2018).
The value of future tax deductions in relation to share programmes is recognised 
as deferred tax, until the shares are paid out to the employees. Any estimated 
excess tax deduction compared to the costs realised in the income statement is 
charged to equity.
Deferred income taxes
Accounting policies
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the accounting 
and tax values of the individual consolidated companies and from realisable tax 
loss carry-forwards. The tax value of tax loss carry-forwards is included in deferred 
tax assets to the extent that these are expected to be utilised in future taxable 
income. The deferred income taxes are measured according to current tax rules 
and at the tax rates assumed in the year in which the assets are expected to be 
utilised.

3.1 Intangible assets
Accounting policies
Patents and licences, including patents and licences acquired for research and 
development projects, are carried at historical cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any impairment loss. Amortisation is based on the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful life. This means the legal duration or the economic useful life 
depending on which is shorter, and not exceeding 15 years. The amortisation of 
patents and licences begins after regulatory approval has been obtained.
Internal development of software for internal use is recognised as intangible assets 
if the recognition criteria are met, for example a significant business system where 
the expenditure leads to the creation of a durable asset. Amortisation is based on 
the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 3-15 years. The amortisa-
tion begins when the asset is in the location and condition necessary for it to be 
capable of operating in the manner intended by Management.
Research and development projects
Internal and subcontracted research costs are charged in full to the consolidated 
income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Consistent with 
industry practice, internal development costs are also expensed until regulatory 
approval is obtained or is probable; please refer to note 2.3.
Payments to third parties under collaboration and license agreements are assessed for 
the substance of their nature. Payments which represent subcontracted research and 
development are expensed as the services are received. Payments which represent rights 
to the transfer of intellectual property, developed at risk by the third party, are capitalised.
For acquired research and development projects, patents and licences the likeli-
hood of obtaining future commercial sales is reflected in the cost of the asset, and 
thus the probability recognition criteria is always considered to be satisfied. As 
the cost of acquired research and development projects can often be measured 
reliably, these projects fulfil the capitalisation criteria as intangible assets on acqui-
sition. Subsequent milestone payments payable on achievement of a contingent 
event (e.g. commencement of phase 3 trials) are accrued and capitalised into 
the cost of the intangible asset when the achievement of the event is probable. 
However, further internal development costs subsequent to acquisition are treated 
in the same way as other internal development costs.
Key accounting estimates of impairment of assets
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet avail-
able for use are not subject to amortisation. They are tested annually for impair-
ment, irrespective of whether there is any indication that they may be impaired. 
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not 
be recoverable. Factors considered material that could trigger an impairment test 
include the following:
• Development of a competing drug
• Changes in the legal framework covering patents, rights and licences
• Advances in medicine and/or technology that affect the medical treatments
• Lower-than-predicted sales
• Adverse impact on reputation and/or brand names
• Changes in the economic lives of similar assets
• Relationship to other intangible assets or property, plant and equipment
•  Changes or anticipated changes in participation rates or reimbursement policies.
If the carrying amount of intangible assets exceeds the recoverable amount based 
on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, any 
impairment is measured based on discounted projected cash flows. Impairments 
are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal.

3.1 Intangible assets (continued)
Amortisation and impairment losses
In 2019, an impairment loss of DKK 982 million was recognised (no impairment 
losses were recognised in 2018), substantially all of which related to patents 
and licences. DKK 282 million of the impairment was related to the Diabetes 
and Obesity care segment and DKK 700 million of the impairment was related 
to Biopharm. Of the total impairment loss, DKK 529 million was recognised in 
cost of goods sold and DKK 450 million in research and development costs. The 
impairment was a result of Management’s review of projected future cash flows 
from marketable products and expectations related to patents and licences not yet 
in use. 
The impairment losses related to marketable products were based on fair value 
less cost of disposal calculations. The projected future cash flows were prepared 
based on Management’s expectations for market access, market share and devel-
opment in net sales prices. Management has used a post-tax discount rate of 7%. 
The inherent risk and uncertainty related to cash flows were adjusted for in the 
expected future cash flows.
Intangible assets not yet in use amount to DKK 3,380 million (DKK 2,612 million 
in 2018), primarily patents and licences in relation to research and development 
projects. Impairment tests in 2019 and 2018 of patents and licences not yet in 
use are based on Management’s projections and anticipated net present value of 
estimated future cash flows from marketable products. Terminal values used are 
based on the expected life of products, forecasted life cycle and cash flow over 
that period, and the useful life of the underlying assets.
3.2 Property, plant and equipment
Novo Nordisk ́s approach to managing operating assets is to retain assets for 
research, development and production activities under the company’s own control, 
and to lease non-core assets related to e.g. administration and distribution. 
Management believes this is a significant factor in maintaining the quality of the 
company ́s products. 
Accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment is measured at historical cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment loss. The cost of self-constructed assets includes 
costs directly and indirectly attributable to the construction of the assets. Any 
subsequent cost is included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a 
separate asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the item will flow to Novo Nordisk and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. Depreciation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated 
useful lives of the assets:
• Buildings: 12-50 years
• Plant and machinery: 5-20 years
• Other equipment: 3-10 years
• Land: not depreciated.
The depreciation commences when the asset is available for use, i.e. when it is 
in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by Management.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appro-
priate, at the end of each reporting period. If an asset’s carrying amount is higher 
than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to the recoverable 
amount. 
Plant and equipment with no alternative use developed as part of a research and 
development project are expensed. However, plant and equipment with an alter-
native use or used for general research and development purposes are capitalised 
and depreciated over the estimated useful life as research and development costs.
Capital expenditure in the reported period was primarily related to investments in 
facility upgrades and new production facilities for active pharmaceutical ingredi-
ents for diabetes, mainly the facility in Clayton, US. The facility in Clayton will also 
be used for tableting and packing of oral products. 
Capital expenditure also related to new diabetes filling capacity in Hillerød. The 
facility will serve as a backup production facility for the US market and act as a 
launch site for new injectable diabetes products.
Finally, capital expenditure related to expansion of the facility in Chartres, France. 
The investment will establish FlexTouch® assembly and packaging capacity at the 
Chartres site.

3.3 Leases
Accounting policies
Novo Nordisk mainly leases office buildings, warehouses, laboratories and vehicles. 
For contracts which are, or contain, a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use 
asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, being 
the initial amount of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is subsequently 
depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term. The right-of-use 
asset is periodically adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability and 
reduced by any impairment losses. 
The lease term determined by the Group is the non-cancellable period of a lease, 
together with extension/termination option if these are reasonably certain to be 
exercised.  
When determining the term, Management considers multiple factors that create 
economic incentives to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to terminate 
the lease, including termination penalties, potential relocation costs and whether 
significant leasehold improvements have been capitalised on the lease, with a 
remaining useful life which exceeds the fixed minimum duration of the lease. 
For contracts with a rolling term (evergreen leases), the Group estimates the 
leasing period to be equal to the termination period if no probable scenario exists 
for estimating the leasing period. 
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments 
outstanding at the commencement date, discounted using the incremental 
borrowing rate. Lease payments consist of the following payments:
• fixed payments from commencement date
• certain variable payments
• residual value guarantees or the exercise price of a purchase option
• termination penalties
The lease liability is measured using the effective interest method. 
The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments, 
typically due to a change in index or rate (e.g. inflation) on property leases, or 
if there is a reassessment of whether an extension or termination option will be 
exercised. A corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset, or in the 
income statement when the right-of-use asset has been fully depreciated.
The right-of-use asset is presented in property, plant and equipment and the lease 
liability in borrowings.

Consolidated Financial Statements57

3.3 Leases (continued) 
New lease contracts with a lease term of 12 months or less and lease of low value  
assets are not recognised on the balance sheet. These are expensed on a straight-
line basis over the lease term or another systematic basis. Lease of low value assets 
include personal computers, telephones and small items of office equipment.
Variable lease payments may depend on an index, a rate or other elements. 
Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in 
the initial measurement of the lease liability using the index/rate at the lease 
commencement date. Variable lease payments not based on an index or a rate are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Residual value guarantees that are expected to be paid are included in the initial 
measurement of the lease liability. Please refer to note 4.2. 
As of 31 December 2019, the lease liability excludes DKK 2,760 million (undis-
counted) of potential lease payments related to lease term extension rights on 
properties, which were not considered reasonably certain to be exercised. 
Property, plant and equipment presented in the balance sheet includes the 
following right-of-use assets.

3.4 Inventories
Accounting policies
Inventories are stated at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost is 
determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost comprises direct production 
costs such as raw materials, consumables and labour as well as indirect production 
costs. Production costs for work in progress and finished goods include indirect 
production costs such as employee costs, depreciation, maintenance, etc.
If the expected sales price less completion costs to execute sales (net realisable 
value) is lower than the carrying amount, a write-down is recognised for the 
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its net realisable value.
Inventory manufactured prior to regulatory approval (prelaunch inventory) is capi-
talised but immediately provided for, until there is a high probability of regulatory 
approval for the product. A write-down is made against inventory, and the cost 
is recognised in the income statement as research and development costs. Once 
there is a high probability of regulatory approval being obtained, the write-down 
is reversed, up to no more than the original cost.
In March 2019, Novo Nordisk filed oral semaglutide for US regulatory approval 
of glycaemic control. Subsequent to filing, write-downs on prelaunch inventory 
was reversed with a net positive income statement effect of DKK 510 million on 
research and development costs. Regulatory approval was obtained in September 
2019.
Key accounting estimate of indirect production costs capitalised and 
inventory write-downs
Indirect production costs account for approximately 50% of the net inventory 
value, reflecting a lengthy production process compared with low direct raw 
material costs. The production of both Diabetes and Obesity care and Biopharm 
products is highly complex from fermentation to purification and formulation, 
including quality control of all production processes. Furthermore, the process 
is very sensitive to manufacturing conditions. These factors all influence the 
parameters for capitalisation of indirect production costs at Novo Nordisk and the 
full cost of the products. Indirect production costs are measured using a standard 
cost method. This is reviewed regularly to ensure relevant measures of capacity 
utilisation, production lead time, cost base and other relevant factors, hence 
inventory is valued at actual cost. When calculating total inventory, Management 
must make judgements about cost of production, standard cost variances and idle 
capacity in estimating indirect production costs for capitalisation. Changes in the 
parameters for calculation of indirect production costs could have an impact on 
the gross margin and the overall valuation of inventories.

3.5 Trade receivables
Accounting policies
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for doubtful 
trade receivables.
 
Before being sold, trade receivables in factoring portfolios are measured at fair 
value with changes recognised in other comprehensive income. 
The allowance for doubtful receivables is deducted from the carrying amount 
of Trade receivables, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income 
statement under Sales and distribution costs. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited against sales and distribution costs.
Novo Nordisk’s customer base comprises government agencies, wholesalers, retail 
pharmacies and other customers. Management makes allowance for doubtful 
trade receivables based on the simplified approach to provide for expected credit 
losses, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade 
receivables. The allowance is an estimate based on shared credit risk characteristics 
and the days past due. Generally, invoices are due for payment within 90 days of 
shipment of goods.
Loss allowance is calculated using an ageing factor, geographical risk and specific 
customer knowledge. The allowance is based on a provision matrix on days past 
due and a forward looking element relating mainly to incorporation of the Dun & 
Bradstreet country risk rating and an individual assessment. Please refer to note 
4.3 for a general description of credit risk.
Many of the countries within Region AAMEO have significant sales and low credit 
ratings. As such, this region has a relatively high impact on the allowance for 
doubtful trade receivables. 
Novo Nordisk closely monitors the current economic conditions of countries 
impacted by currency fluctuations, high inflation and an unstable political climate.  
These indicators as well as payment history are taken into account in the valuation 
of trade receivables. Please refer to note 2.2 for a geographical split of trade 
receivables and allowance for doubtful trade receivables, and notes 4.3 and 4.8 
for the trade receivable programmes.

3.6 Retirement benefit obligations
Accounting policies
Defined contribution plans
Novo Nordisk operates a number of defined contribution plans throughout the 
world. These plans are externally funded in entities that are legally separate from 
the Group. Novo Nordisk’s contributions to the defined contribution plans are 
charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate.
Defined benefit plans
In a few countries, Novo Nordisk operates defined benefit plans, primarily located 
in the US, Germany, Switzerland and Japan. In Germany and Switzerland, the 
defined benefit plans are partly reimbursed by international insurance companies. 
The risk related to the plan assets in these countries is therefore limited to coun-
terparty risk against these insurance companies. 
Recognition of defined benefit plans
The costs for the year for defined benefit plans are determined using the projected 
unit credit method. This reflects services rendered by employees to the valua-
tion dates and is based on actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount 
rates used in determining the present value of benefits and projected rates of 
remuneration growth. Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-rated 
corporate bonds in the country concerned.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to other comprehensive income in 
the period in which they arise. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Pension plan assets are only recognised to the extent that Novo Nordisk is able to 
derive future economic benefits such as refunds from the plan or reductions of 
future contributions. 
Costs recognised for retirement benefits are included in cost of goods sold, sales 
and distribution costs, research and development costs, and administrative costs. 
The total cost recognised for the year amounts to DKK 151 million (DKK 73 million 
in 2018). 
The net obligation recognised in the balance sheet is reported as non-current 
liabilities.

Fair value of plan assets1,1741,232
Net retirement benefit obligations at the end 
of the year1,3341,256
The present value of partly funded retirement benefit obligations amounts to DKK 
1,845 million (DKK 1,841 million in 2018). The present value of unfunded retire-
ment benefit obligations amounts to DKK 663 million (DKK 647 million in 2018).
Net remeasurement is a loss of DKK 187 million (gain of DKK 87 million in 2018), 
primarily related to changes in financial assumptions (discount rate), and is 
included in other comprehensive income.
Please refer to note 5.2 for a maturity analysis of the net retirement benefit obliga-
tion. Novo Nordisk does not expect the contributions over the next five years to 
differ significantly from current contributions.
Actuarial valuations are performed annually for all major defined benefit plans. 
Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in
accordance with published statistics and experience in each country. Other 
assumptions such as medical cost trend rate and inflation are also considered in 
the calculation.
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the retirement benefit 
obligation (not considering plan assets) are discount rate and expected future 
remuneration increases. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based 
on reasonably likely changes in the assumptions occurring at the end of the 
period.
The sensitivities below consider the single change shown with the other 
assumptions assumed to be unchanged. The table shows the NPV impact of net 
retirement liabilities.

3.7 Provisions and contingent liabilities
Accounting policies
Provisions for sales rebates and discounts granted to government agencies, 
wholesalers, retail pharmacies, Managed Care and other customers are recorded 
at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentives are offered. 
Provisions are calculated based on historical experience and the specific terms 
in the individual agreements. Unsettled rebates are recognised as provisions 
when the timing or amount is uncertain. Where absolute amounts are known, 
the rebates are recognised as other liabilities. Please refer to note 2.1 for further 
information on sales rebates and provisions.
Provisions for legal disputes are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation 
has been incurred as a result of past events and it is probable that there will be 
an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated. In this case, Novo Nordisk 
arrives at an estimate based on an evaluation of the most likely outcome. Disputes 
for which no reliable estimate can be made are disclosed as contingent liabilities.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the anticipated expenditure for 
settlement. This is calculated using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
obligation. The increase in the provision for interest is recognised as a financial 
expense.
Novo Nordisk issues credit notes for expired goods as a part of normal business. 
Where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of expected 
future returns can otherwise be made, a provision for estimated product returns is 
recorded. The provision is measured at gross sales value.
Key accounting estimate regarding ongoing legal disputes, litigation and 
investigations
Provisions for legal disputes consist of various types of provision linked to ongoing 
legal disputes. Management makes estimates regarding provisions and contingen-
cies, including the probability of pending and potential future litigation outcomes. 
These are by nature dependent on inherently uncertain future events. When 
determining likely outcomes of litigation, etc. Management considers the input of 
external counsels on each case, as well as known outcomes in case law.
Although Management believes that the total provisions for legal proceedings 
are adequate based on currently available information, there can be no assurance 
that there will not be any changes in facts or matters, or that any future lawsuits, 
claims, proceedings or investigations will not be material.

Contingent liabilities
Novo Nordisk is currently involved in pending litigations, claims and investiga-
tions arising out of the normal conduct of its business. While provisions that 
Management deems to be reasonable and appropriate have been made for prob-
able losses, there are uncertainties connected with these estimates. Novo Nordisk 
does not expect the pending litigations, claims and investigations, individually and 
in the aggregate, to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, 
operating profit or cash flow in addition to the amounts accrued as provision for 
legal disputes.
Pending litigation against Novo Nordisk
Novo Nordisk, along with the majority of incretin-based product manufacturers 
in the United States, is a defendant in product liability lawsuits related to use of 
incretin-based medications. As of 3 February 2020, 332 plaintiffs have named 
Novo Nordisk in product liability lawsuits, predominantly claiming damages for 
pancreatic cancer that allegedly developed as a result of using Victoza
®
 and other 
GLP-1/DPP-IV incretin-based products. 209 of the Novo Nordisk plaintiffs have also 
named other defendants in their lawsuits. Most Novo Nordisk plaintiffs have filed 
suit in California federal and state courts. Novo Nordisk does not currently have any 
individual trials scheduled in 2020. Novo Nordisk does not expect the pending claims 
to have a material impact on its financial position, operating profit or cash flow.
Since January 2017, several class action lawsuits have been filed against Novo 
Nordisk, former CEO Lars Rebien Sørensen, former CFO Jesper Brandgaard and 
former President of Novo Nordisk Inc. Jakob Riis in the United States District 
Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all purchasers of Novo Nordisk 
American Depositary Receipts between February 2015 and February 2017. All 
lawsuits have been consolidated into one case. The lawsuit alleges that Novo 
Nordisk artificially inflated its financial results, failed to disclose pricing pressure 
and rising rebate payments to PBMs, and made other materially misleading state-
ments to potential investors. Novo Nordisk does not expect the litigation to have a 
material impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.

In all matters Novo Nordisk is cooperating with the authority in question. Novo 
Nordisk does not expect the above investigations to have a material impact on 
Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.
Novo Nordisk is one of several pharmaceutical companies that received requests 
for information involving pricing practices for its diabetes products from several 
committees of the Unites States House of Representatives and/or United States 
Senate. Novo Nordisk is working with the staff of the various committees to 
respond to their questions. Novo Nordisk does not expect the inquiries to have a 
material impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.
Other contingent liabilities
In addition to the above, the Novo Nordisk Group is engaged in certain litigation  
proceedings and various ongoing audits and investigations. In the opinion of 
Management, neither settlement or continuation of such proceedings, nor such 
pending audits and investigations, are expected to have a material effect on Novo 
Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.
3.7 Provisions and contingent liabilities (continued)
In August 2019, a securities lawsuit was filed against Novo Nordisk in Denmark 
by a number of institutional shareholders. The claim is for a total amount of 
DKK 11.6 billion based on trading and holding of shares in Novo Nordisk during 
the period between February 2015 and February 2017. The lawsuit alleges 
that Novo Nordisk made misleading statements and did not make appropriate 
disclosures regarding its sales of insulin products in the US. It appears to contain 
broadly similar allegations to those of the previously disclosed securities class 
action lawsuit filed in the US in 2017 on behalf of all purchasers of Novo Nordisk 
American Depository Receipts. Novo Nordisk does not expect the lawsuit to have a 
material impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.
Since January 2017, thirteen lawsuits, including several putative class actions, have 
been filed in various federal and state courts against Novo Nordisk Inc., Sanofi, Eli 
Lilly, and others relating to the pricing of diabetes medicines. Six of these lawsuits 
were consolidated into one matter pending in the United States District Court 
for the District of New Jersey, yet one of these six lawsuits was later decon-
solidated and voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Additionally, two of the 
thirteen lawsuits were also voluntarily dismissed in 2019 and 2020.  Accordingly, 
six lawsuits remain pending against Novo Nordisk in various jurisdictions.  Three 
lawsuits are pending in the same New Jersey federal court as the consolidated 
matter referenced above, while two other lawsuits are pending in other jurisdic-
tions (Kentucky state court and Texas federal court). All pending matters allege 
that the manufacturers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) colluded to 
artificially inflate list prices paid by consumers for diabetes products, while offering 
reduced prices to PBMs through rebates used to secure formulary access.  Novo 
Nordisk does not expect the lawsuits to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk’s 
financial position, operating profit or cash flow.
Pending claims against Novo Nordisk and investigations
involving Novo Nordisk
Several authorities in the US have served Novo Nordisk with Civil Investigative 
Demands (CIDs) or subpoenas calling for the production of documents and infor-
mation. Below is a list of ongoing matters:
•   United States Department of Justice CID (2016) and Washington State Attorney 
General’s Office CID (2014 and 2016) both relating to, among other things, 
the promotion and marketing of NovoSeven
®
, interactions with physicians and 
patients, and the use of haemophilia-related patient support programmes.
3.8 Other liabilities
Other liabilities primarily comprises employee cost payables, payables related to 
non-current assets and sales rebates.

(equal to 1,863 million B shares of DKK 0.20). Each A share carries 200 votes and each B share carries 20 votes.   
Cash distribution to shareholders
Novo Nordisk paid out an interim dividend of DKK 3.00 per share in August 2019. The net cash distribution to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases 
amounts to DKK 34.7 billion, compared with a free cash flow of DKK 34.5 billion. This is in line with the guiding principle of paying out excess capital to investors after 
funding organic growth and potential acquisitions.

The total dividend for 2019 amounts to DKK 19,651 million (DKK 8.35 per share). The 2019 final dividend of DKK 12,551 million (DKK 5.35 per share) is expected to be 
distributed pending approval at the Annual General Meeting. The interim dividend of DKK 7,100 million (DKK 3.00 per share) was paid in August 2019. The total dividend 
for 2018 was DKK 19,547 million (DKK 8.15 per share), of which the final dividend of DKK 12,309 million (DKK 5.15 per share) was paid in March 2019. No dividend is 
declared on treasury shares.
According to Danish corporate law, reserves available for distribution as dividends are based on the financial statements of the parent company, Novo Nordisk A/S.
Dividends are paid from distributable reserves. Share premium is a distributable reserve and any former share premium reserve has been fully distributed. 
As at 31 December 2019, distributable reserves total DKK 40,801 million (2018: DKK 38,816 million), corresponding to the parent company's retained earnings.
Treasury shares
Accounting policies
Treasury shares are deducted from the share capital on cancellation at their nominal value of DKK 0.20 per share. Differences between this amount and the amount paid 
to acquire or received for disposing of treasury shares are deducted directly in Equity.

Novo Nordisk’s guiding principle is that any excess capital, after the funding of organic growth opportunities and potential acquisitions, should be returned to investors. 
Novo Nordisk’s dividend payouts are complemented by share repurchase programmes.
The purchase of treasury shares during the year relates to the remaining part of the 2018 share repurchase programme, totalling DKK 1.2 billion and the DKK 15 billion 
Novo Nordisk B share repurchase programme for 2019, of which DKK 0.9 billion was outstanding at year-end. The programme ended on 3 February 2020. Transfer of 
treasury shares relates to the long-term share-based incentive programme and restricted stock units to employees.
Earnings per share
Accounting policies
Earnings per share is presented as both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is calculated as net profit divided by the average number of shares 
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated as net profit divided by the sum of average number of shares outstanding, including the dilutive effect of the 
outstanding share pool. Please refer to ‘Financial definitions’ for a description of calculation of the dilutive effect.

4.3 Financial risks
Novo Nordisk has centralised management of the Group’s financial risks. The 
overall objectives and policies for the company’s financial risk management are 
outlined in an internal Treasury Policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. 
The Treasury Policy consists of the Foreign Exchange Policy, the Investment 
Policy, the Financing Policy and the policy regarding Credit Risk on Financial 
Counterparts, and includes a description of permitted use of financial instruments 
and risk limits.
Novo Nordisk only hedges commercial exposures and consequently does not enter 
into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes. Novo Nordisk uses 
a fully integrated Treasury Management System to manage all financial positions, 
and all positions are marked-to-market. Management has assessed the following 
key financial risks:
TypeFinancial risk
Foreign exchange riskHigh
Interest rate riskLow
Liquidity riskLow
Credit riskLow
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the most important financial risk for Novo Nordisk and 
can have a significant impact on the income statement, statement of comprehen-
sive income, balance sheet and cash flow statement.
The overall objective of foreign exchange risk management is to reduce the short-
term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, 
thereby contributing to the predictability of the financial results.
The majority of Novo Nordisk’s sales are in USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, CAD and GBP. 
The foreign exchange risk is most significant in USD, CNY and JPY, while the EUR 
exchange rate risk is regarded as low because of Denmark’s fixed exchange rate 
policy towards EUR.
Novo Nordisk hedges existing assets and liabilities in key currencies as well as 
future expected cash flows up to a maximum of 24 months forward. Hedge 
accounting is applied to match the impact of the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument in the consolidated income statement. Management has chosen to 
classify the result of hedging activities as part of financial items. 
During 2019, the hedging horizon varied between 6 and 13 months for USD, 
CNY, JPY, CAD and GBP. The currency hedging strategy balances risk reduction 
and cost of hedging by use of foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange 
options matching the due dates of the hedged items. Expected cash flows are 
continually assessed using historical inflows, budgets and monthly sales forecasts. 
Hedge effectiveness is assessed on a regular basis. There is no expected ineffec-
tiveness at 31 December 2019, primarily because hedging instruments match 
currencies of hedged cash flows. 
The financial contracts existing at year-end cover the expected future cash flow for 
the following number of months:
20192018
USD9 months11 months

income statement by DKK 135 million (2018: DKK 157 million).
The foreign exchange sensitivity analysis comprises effects from the Group’s cash, 
trade receivables and trade payables, current loans, current and non-current 
financial investments, lease liabilities, foreign exchange forwards and foreign 
exchange options at year-end. Anticipated currency transactions, investments and 
non-current assets are not included.
Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2019Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2019
Consolidated Financial Statements65

4.3 Financial risks (continued)
Interest rate risk
Novo Nordisk has no significant exposure to interest rate risk as it does not hold 
any significant interest-bearing marketable securities or non-current loans.  
Liquidity risk
The liquidity risk is considered to be low, and Novo Nordisk has limited debt 
financing. Novo Nordisk ensures the availability of the required liquidity through 
a combination of cash management, highly liquid investment portfolios and both 
uncommitted and committed credit facilities. Novo Nordisk uses cash pools for 
optimisation and centralisation of cash management.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that transactional counterparties may 
default on their obligations, causing financial losses for the Group. Novo Nordisk 
considers its maximum credit exposure to financial counterparties to be DKK 
15,663 million (2018: DKK 15,842 million). In addition, Novo Nordisk considers its 
maximum credit exposure to trade receivables, other receivables (less prepayments 
and VAT receivables) and other financial assets to be DKK 26,622 million (2018: 
DKK 25,065 million). Please refer to note 4.8 for details of the Group’s total 
financial assets. 
To manage credit risk regarding financial counterparties, Novo Nordisk only enters 
into derivative financial contracts and money market deposits with financial 
counterparties possessing a satisfactory long-term credit rating from at least two 
out of the three selected ratings agencies: Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. 
Furthermore, maximum credit lines defined for each counterparty diversify the 
overall counterparty risk. The table below shows Novo Nordisk’s credit exposure 
on cash and financial derivatives.

Total15,63820415,842
Outside the US, Novo Nordisk has no significant concentration of credit risk 
related to trade receivables or other receivables and prepayments, as the exposure 
in general is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. In the 
US, the three major wholesalers account for a large proportion of total net sales, 
cf. note 2.2. However, US wholesaler credit ratings are monitored and a large 
proportion of the trade receivables are sold on full non-recourse terms; see below 
for details. Novo Nordisk continues to monitor the credit exposure in Region 
AAMEO due to the increasing sales and low credit ratings of many countries in 
this region.
Trade receivable programmes
Please refer to note 3.5 for the description of the loss allowance for the Group 
and the ageing analysis. 
Novo Nordisk’s subsidiaries in the US and Japan employ trade receivable 
programmes in which trade receivables are sold on full non-recourse terms to 
optimise working capital.
At year-end, the Group had derecognised receivables without recourse having due 
dates after 31 December 2019 amounting to:
DKK million201920182017
US3,6723,5873,328
Japan2,1491,9372,024
In addition, full non-recourse off-balance sheet factoring arrangement 
programmes are occasionally applied by Novo Nordisk subsidiaries around the 
world, with limited impact on the Group’s trade receivables.
Please refer to note 2.2 for the split of allowance for trade receivables by 
geographical segment.
Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2019Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2019
Consolidated Financial Statements66

Discontinuance of cash flow hedging
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets 
the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity 
at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity 
is immediately transferred to the income statement under financial income or 
financial expenses.
Fair value determination
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is measured on the basis of 
quoted market prices of financial instruments traded in active markets. If an active 
market exists, the fair value is based on the most recently observed market price at 
the end of the reporting period.
If a financial instrument is quoted in a market that is not active, Novo Nordisk 
bases its valuation on the most recent transaction price. 
Adjustment is made for subsequent changes in market conditions, for instance by 
including transactions in similar financial instruments assumed to be motivated by 
normal business considerations.
If an active market does not exist, the fair value of standard and simple financial 
instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps, 
currency swaps and unlisted bonds, is measured according to generally accepted 
valuation techniques. Market-based parameters are used to measure the fair 
value.

The above financial contracts are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges then being 
transferred to financial income or financial expenses.
4.4 Derivative financial instruments
Accounting policies
Novo Nordisk uses financial instruments to reduce the impact of foreign exchange 
on financial results.
Use of derivative financial instruments
The derivative financial instruments are used to manage the exposure to market 
risk. None of the derivatives are held for trading.
Novo Nordisk uses forward exchange contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency 
options to hedge forecast transactions, assets and liabilities. The overall policy is to 
hedge the majority of total currency exposure.
Net investments in foreign subsidiaries are currently not hedged.
Initial recognition and measurement
On initiation of the contract, Novo Nordisk designates each derivative financial 
contract that qualifies for hedge accounting as one of:
• hedges of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge)
• hedges of the fair value of a forecast financial transaction (cash flow hedge).
All contracts are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured at 
fair value at the end of the reporting period.
Fair value hedges
Value adjustments of fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement 
along with any value adjustments of the hedged asset or liability that are attribut-
able to the hedged risk.
Cash flow hedges
Value adjustments of the effective part of cash flow hedges are recognised 
directly in other comprehensive income. The cumulative value adjustment of these 
contracts is transferred from other comprehensive income to the income state-
ment when the hedged transaction is recognised in the income statement.

4.5 Cash and cash equivalents, financial resources and 
free cash flow
Accounting policies
The cash flow statement shows how income and changes in balance sheet items 
affect cash and cash equivalents, in other words the cash generated or used in the 
period.
The cash flow statement is presented in accordance with the indirect method 
commencing with net profit for the year. Cash flows in foreign currencies are 
translated to DKK at the average exchange rate for the respective year.
Cash from operating activities converts income statement items from the accrual 
basis of accounting to cash basis. As such, starting with net profit, non-cash 
items are reversed and actual payments included. The change in working capital 
is also taken into account, as this shows the development in money tied up in 
the balance sheet. Cash from investing activities shows payments related to the 
purchase and sale of Novo Nordisk’s long-term investments. This includes fixed 
assets such as construction of new production sites, intangible assets such as 
patents and licences, and financial assets.
Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash offset by short-term bank loans. Where 
short-term bank loans are consistently overdrawn, they are excluded from cash 
and cash equivalents. The movement in such facilities is presented under financing 
activities in the cash flow statement
1
. Financial resources consist of cash and cash 
equivalents, marketable securities with original maturity of less than three months 
and undrawn committed credit facilities expiring after more than one year.
Restricted cash
Cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2019 includes DKK 509 million that is 
restricted (2018: DKK 120 million). The restricted cash balance relates to subsidi-
aries in which availability of currency for remittance of funds is temporarily scarce.

4.8 Financial assets and liabilities
Accounting policies
The implementation of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 resulted in changes to the 
classification of financial assets. Key changes from the application of IFRS 9 were:
From 1 January 2018, Novo Nordisk's investments in minor shareholdings are 
measured and classified as fair value through the income statement (previously 
measurement was at fair value through other comprehensive income).
From 1 January 2018, all financial assets previously categorised as loans and 
receivables are classified as financial assets at amortised cost with the exception 
of certain portfolios of trade receivables which are either sold under master 
factoring agreements or collected from the customer. These specific portfolios of 
trade receivables are separately classified and measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income.
Depending on purpose, Novo Nordisk classifies investments into the following categories:
• Financial assets at fair value through the income statement
• Financial assets at amortised cost
• Financial assets at fair value through OCI
Management determines the classification of its financial assets on initial recogni-
tion and re-evaluates this at the end of every reporting period to the extent that 
such a classification is permitted or required.
Recognition and measurement
Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the settlement date. 
These are initially recognised at fair value.
Fair value disclosures are made separately for each class of financial instruments at 
the end of the reporting period.
Financial assets are removed from the balance sheet when the rights to receive 
cash flows have expired or have been transferred, and Novo Nordisk has trans-
ferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets 'at fair value through the income statement'
Financial assets at fair value through the income statement consist of equity 
investments and forward exchange contracts. Equity investments are included in 
other financial assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment 
within 12 months of the end of the reporting period. In that case, the current part 
is included in other receivables and prepayments.
Net gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets are 
recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses. 
The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices at the end of 
the reporting period. Financial assets for which no active market exists are carried 
at fair value based on a valuation methodology.
Financial assets 'at amortised cost'
Financial assets at amortised cost are cash at bank and non-derivative financial assets 
solely with payments of principal and interest. Novo Nordisk normally 'holds-to-col-
lect' the financial assets to attain the contractual cash flows. If collection is expected 
within one year (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are 
classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. 
Subsequently they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less allowance for doubtful receivables. 
Financial assets 'at fair value through other comprehensive income'
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are trade receiv-
ables that are held to collect or to sell in factoring agreements.
Financial liabilities 'at fair value through the income statement'
Financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement consist of forward 
exchange contracts.
Financial liabilities 'at amortised cost'
Financial liabilities at amortised cost consist of bank overdrafts, trade payables and 
other liabilities.

1.   The fair value of trade receivables in a factoring portfolio is calculated based on the net invoice amount (invoice amount less charge-backs) less the fee payable to the factoring entity. The 
factoring fee is insignificant due to the short period between the time of sale to the factoring entity and the invoice due date and the rate applicable. Inputs to the estimate of US wholesaler 
charge-backs are described in note 2.1.  
 
4.9 Financial income and expenses
Accounting policies
As described in note 4.3, Management has chosen to classify the result of 
hedging activities as part of financial items in the income statement. Financial 
items primarily relate to foreign exchange elements and are mainly impacted 
by the cumulative value adjustment of cash flow hedges transferred from other 
comprehensive income to the income statement when the hedged transaction is 
recognised in the income statement. In addition, value adjustments of fair value 
hedges are recognised in financial income and financial expenses along with 
any value adjustments of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the 
hedged risk. Finally, value adjustments of foreign currency assets and liabilities in 
non-hedged currencies will impact financial income and financial expenses.

market data’ and ’Directly or indirectly observable market data’ categories during 2019, 2018 or 2017. There are no significant intangible assets or items of property, 
plant and equipment measured at fair value.

5.1 Share-based payment schemes
Accounting policies
Share-based compensation
Novo Nordisk operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of 
shares is recognised as an expense and allocated over the vesting period.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the shares granted, excluding the impact of any 
non-market vesting conditions. The fair value is fixed at the grant date, and 
adjusted for expected dividends during the vesting period. Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares that are 
expected to vest. At the end of each reporting period, Novo Nordisk revises its 
estimates of the number of shares expected to vest. Novo Nordisk recognises the 
impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, in the income statement 
and in a corresponding adjustment to equity (change in proceeds) over the 
remaining vesting period. Adjustments relating to prior years are included in the 
income statement in the year of adjustment.

1.   In 2017 Novo Nordisk introduced, for the first time, a share-based compensation pro-
gramme with terms which amortises the grant date valuation over four years. The 2019 
expense includes amortisation of the 2017, 2018 and 2019 programmes.  
 
Restricted stock units to employees
In appreciation of the efforts of employees during recent years, as of 1 August 
2019, all employees in the company were offered 75 restricted stock units. A 
restricted stock unit gives the holder the right to receive one Novo Nordisk B share 
free of charge in February 2023 subject to continued employment. The cost of the 
DKK 660 million programme is amortised over the vesting period.
 
Long-term share-based incentive programme
Management Board
On 4 February 2020, the Board of Directors approved the allocation of a total of 
508,398 Novo Nordisk B shares to the members of the Management Board for the 
2019 financial year. The value at launch of the programme (adjusted for expected 
dividends) was DKK 152 million. On average, this corresponds to 14.7 months’ 
fixed base salary plus pension contribution for the CEO, 11.0 months’ fixed base 
salary plus pension contribution per executive vice president as of 1 March 2019 
and 8.2 months’ fixed base salary plus pension for senior vice presidents. The 
cost of the 2019 programme is amortised over the vesting period of 2019-2022 
at an annual amount of DKK 38 million. The amount of shares allocated may be 
reduced or increased by up to 30%, depending on whether the average sales 
growth per year in the three-year vesting period deviates from a target set by the 
Board of Directors.
The grant date of the programme was February 2019, and the share price used 
for the determining the grant date fair value of the award was the average share 
price (DKK 322) for Novo Nordisk B shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen in the period 
1-15 February 2019, adjusted for expected dividend. Based on the split of partici-
pants when the share allocation was decided, 43% of the allocated shares will be 
allocated to members of Executive Management and 57% to other members of 
the Management Board.
The shares allocated to the joint pool for 2016 were released to the individual 
participants subsequent to approval of the 2019 Annual Report by the Board of 
Directors and after the announcement of the 2019 full-year financial results on 
5 February 2020. The shares allocated correspond to a value at launch of the 
programme of DKK 29 million, expensed in 2016. 
Management group below Management Board
The management group below the Management Board has a share-based incen-
tive programme with similar performance criteria. For 2019, a total of 1,300,333 
shares were allocated to this group, corresponding to a value at launch of the 
programme (adjusted for expected dividends) of DKK 387 million. The cost of the 
2019 programme is amortised over the vesting period of 2019-2022 at an annual 
amount of DKK 97 million. The amount of shares allocated may be reduced or 
increased by up to 30%, depending on whether the average sales growth per 
year in the three-year vesting period deviates from a target set by the Board of 
Directors.
The shares allocated for 2016 were released to the individual participants subse-
quent to approval of the 2019 Annual Report by the Board of Directors and after 
the announcement of the 2019 full-year financial results on 5 February 2020. 
The shares allocated correspond to a value at launch of the programme of DKK 
68 million amortised over the period 2016-2019. The number of shares to be 
transferred (174,481 shares) is lower than the original number of shares allocated, 
as some participants had left the company before the programme’s release condi-
tions were met.

1.     Predominantly relates to estimated variable property taxes, leases committed not yet 
commenced and low value assets.
2.     There were no material finance lease obligations in 2018.
3.  Potential milestone payments are associated with uncertainty as they are linked to success-
ful achievements in research activities.
The lease commitments are related to IFRS 16 leases primarily for premises and 
company cars and include the present value of future lease payments during the 
lease term. Approximately 74% of the commitments are related to leases outside 
Denmark. 
The purchase obligations primarily relate to purchase agreements regarding 
medical equipment and consumer goods. Novo Nordisk expects to fund these 
commitments with existing cash and cash flow from operations.
Research and development obligations include contingent payments related to 
achieving development milestones. Such amounts entail uncertainties in relation 
to the period in which payments are due because a proportion of the obligations 
is dependent on milestone achievements. Exercise fees and subsequent milestone 
payments under in-licensing option agreements are excluded, as Novo Nordisk 
is not contractually obligated to make such payments. Commercial product 
launch milestones include contingent payments solely related to achievement of a 
commercial product launch following regulatory approval. Commercial milestones, 
royalty and other payments based on a percentage of sales generated from sale of 
goods following marketing approval are excluded from the contractual commit-
ments analysis because of their contingent nature, related to future sales. The due 
periods disclosed are based on Management’s best estimate.

Consolidated Financial Statements75

Financial definitions (part of Management's review – not audited)
Financial ratios have been calculated in accordance with the guidelines from the Danish Society of Financial Analysts, and supplemented by certain key ratios for Novo 
Nordisk. Financial ratios are described below and in the section 'Non-IFRS financial measures'.
ADR
An American Depositary Receipt (or ADR) represents ownership of the shares of a 
non-US company and trades in US financial markets.
Basic earnings per share (EPS) 
Net profit divided by the average number of shares outstanding.
Purchase of property, plant and equipment
Cash flow statement amount for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. 
The definition of capital expenditure has been redefined in 2019. Capital expend-
iture is now defined as purchase of property, plant and equipment from the cash 
flow statement. Amounts for 2015-2018 have been restated in the 'Performance 
highlights'.
Diluted earnings per share 
Net profit divided by average number of shares outstanding, including the dilutive 
effect of the outstanding restricted stock units.
Effective tax rate 
Income taxes as a percentage of profit before income taxes.
Equity ratio 
Total equity at year-end as a percentage of total assets at year-end.
Non-IFRS financial measures
(part of Management's review - not audited)
In the Annual Report, Novo Nordisk discloses certain financial measures of the 
Group’s financial performance, financial position and cash flows that reflect 
adjustments to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented 
in accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS financial measures may not be defined 
and calculated by other companies in the same manner, and may thus not be 
comparable.
The non-IFRS financial measures presented in the Annual Report are:
• Sales and operating profit in constant exchange rates
• Operating profit after tax to net operating assets (OPAT/NOA)
• Financial resources
• Free cash flow
• Cash to earnings
IFRS refers to an IFRS financial measure.
Sales and operating profit growth in constant exchange rates
'Growth in constant exchange rates’ means that the effect of changes in exchange 
rates is excluded. It is defined as sales/operating profit for the period measured 
at the average exchange rates for the same period prior year compared with net 
sales/operating profit for the same period prior year. Price adjustments within 
hyperinflation countries as defined in IAS 29 ‘Financial reporting in hyperinfla-
tion economies’ are excluded from the calculation to avoid growth in constant 
exchange rates being artificially inflated.
Growth in constant exchange rates is considered to be relevant information for 
investors in order to understand the underlying development in sales and oper-
ating profit by adjusting for the impact of currency fluctuations.

items that are required to be presented in OCI are:
• Exchange rate adjustments of investments in subsidiaries.
• Remeasurements of defined benefit plans.
• Changes in fair value of financial instruments in a cash flow hedge.

Operating profit after tax to net operating assets (OPAT/NOA)
Operating profit after tax to net operating assets is defined as ‘operating profit 
after tax (using the effective tax rate) as a percentage of average inventories, 
receivables, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and deferred tax 
assets less non-interest-bearing liabilities including provisions and deferred tax 
liabilities (where average is the sum of the above assets and liabilities at the begin-
ning of the year and at year-end divided by two). 
Management believes operating profit after tax to net operating assets is a useful 
measure in providing investors and Management with information regarding the 
Group's performance. The calculation of this financial target is a widely accepted 
measure of earnings efficiency in relation to total capital employed.
Solely for the purpose of calculating average net operating assets for 2019, 
year-end net operating assets for 2018 have been adjusted upwards by DKK 3,778 
million to DKK 40,541 million, reflecting the recognition by Novo Nordisk of right-
of-use assets of DKK 3,778 million as of 1 January 2019 in accordance with IFRS 
16. Comparative figures for 2018 and 2017 have not been restated. Please refer 
to note 1.2.

1.     Average net operating assets for 2019 is calculated based on an adjusted net operating 
assets figure for 2018, which has been adjusted by the right-of-use assets of DKK 3,778 
million as of 1 January 2019, following the implementation of IFRS 16. As a consequence, 
the net operating assets figure for 2018 has been adjusted to DKK 40,541 million for the 
calculation of the average net operating assets for 2019.
Financial resources 
'Financial resources at the end of the year' is defined as the sum of cash and 
cash equivalents at the end of the year, undrawn committed credit facilities less 
bank overdrafts classified as liabilities arising from financing activities (part of 
borrowings). 
Management believes that financial resources at the end of the year are an 
important measure of the Group's financial strength from an investor's perspec-
tive, capturing the robustness of the Group's financial position and its financial 
preparedness for unforeseen developments.
The following table reconciles total financial resources with cash and cash equiva-
lents, the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure:

Free cash flow
Novo Nordisk used to define free cash flow as ‘net cash generated from operating 
activities’ less ‘net cash used in investing activities’ excluding net change in 
marketable securities. 
From 1 January 2019, Novo Nordisk defines free cash flow as ’net cash generated 
from operating activities’, less ‘net cash used in investing activities’, less repayment 
on lease liabilities and excluding net change of marketable securities. The updated 
definition reflects the implementation of IFRS 16, which accordingly has a neutral 
effect on free cash flow.
Free cash flow is a measure of the amount of cash generated in the period which 
is available for the Board to allocate between Novo Nordisk's capital providers, 
through measures such as dividends, share repurchases and repayment of debt 
(excluding lease liability repayments) or for retaining in the business to fund future 
growth.

Cash to earnings
Cash to earnings is defined as 'free cash flow as a percentage of net profit'.
Management believes that cash to earnings is an important performance 
metric because it measures the Group’s ability to turn earnings into cash. Since 
Management wants this measure to capture the ability of the Group’s operations 
to generate cash, free cash flow is used as the numerator instead of net cash flow.

Basis of preparation
General reporting standards and principles
Novo Nordisk's annual reporting complies with the Danish Financial Statements 
Act. Sections 99a and b specify the requirements of the EU Directive on disclosure 
of non-financial and diversity information to report on management of risks 
related to the environment, climate, human rights, labour and social conditions, 
anti-corruption and gender distribution. This requirement is addressed in the 
Management Review. Novo Nordisk also adheres to the following internationally 
recognised voluntary reporting standards and principles:
•   The International Integrated Reporting Framework, <IR>, developed by the 
International Integrated Reporting Council. The framework consists of a set 
of content elements and guiding principles intended to improve the quality of 
information available to providers of financial capital. 
•    The Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals Sustainability Accounting Standard developed 
by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). The standard consists of a 
set of topics and accounting metrics companies can use to guide their reporting. 
•   The UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework, the only comprehensive 
guidance for companies to report on how they respect human rights. Novo 
Nordisk’s implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights is reported at novonordisk.com.
•   The UK Modern Slavery Act, adopted in 2015, requires commercial organisa-
tions operating in the UK to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking 
statement. Novo Nordisk’s annual statement is available at novonordisk.com.
•   The AA1000AP(2018) and AA1000AS(2008) framework, which states that 
reporting must provide a complete, accurate, relevant and balanced picture of 
the organisation’s approach to and impact on stakeholders and society.

•   The UN Global Compact, a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are 
committed to aligning their operations and strategies with 10 universally 
accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment, anti-cor-
ruption and broader UN Goals. Novo Nordisk’s obligation as a participant in 
the UN Global Compact to provide a Communication on Progress is met by 
inclusion of material information in the Annual Report and additional informa-
tion at novonordisk.com and submitted to the UN Global Compact database at 
unglobalcompact.org.
Novo Nordisk applies AA1000AP(2018) as a component in creating a generally 
applicable approach to assessing and strengthening the credibility of the Group’s 
public reporting of social and environmental information. Novo Nordisk has 
designed processes to ensure that the qualitative and quantitative information that 
documents the social and environmental dimensions of performance is assured, 
as well as the systems that underpin the data and performance. The principles 
outlined in AA1000AP(2018) have been applied as described below.
Inclusivity
As a pharmaceutical business with global reach, Novo Nordisk is committed to 
being accountable to those stakeholders who are impacted by the organisation. 
From the perspective of social responsibility, the key stakeholder groups are 
patients who rely on Novo Nordisk products, employees at Novo Nordisk and 
throughout the Group’s value chain, business partners and local communities. 
Novo Nordisk maps its stakeholders and has processes in place to ensure inclusion 
of stakeholder concerns and expectations. In addition, Novo Nordisk continuously 
develops its stakeholder engagement and capacity to be a sustainable business 
at corporate, regional and affiliate levels. See how Novo Nordisk defines what is 
meant by sustainable business in 'Leading a sustainable business'.
Materiality
Key issues are identified through ongoing stakeholder engagement and trend-
spotting, informed by data-driven analysis and addressed by programmes or 
action plans with clear and measurable targets. Long-term targets are set to guide 
performance in strategic areas. The issues presented in the Annual Report are 
deemed to have a significant impact on the Group’s future business performance 
and may support stakeholders in their decision-making.
Responsiveness
The Annual Report reflects how the company is managing operations in ways that 
respond to and consider stakeholder concerns and interests. The report reaches 
out to a wide range of stakeholders, each with specific needs and interests. The 
management report is prepared with investors in mind. To these stakeholders, 
however, as well as to the many other groups who may seek information in the 
Annual Report, this is just one element of interaction and communication with the 
company.
Impact
Understanding, measuring and communicating the positive and negative impacts 
on society and the environment of Novo Nordisk's activities are important. Novo 
Nordisk is currently working on developing methodologies to be better able to do 
just that covering the entire value chain.
Applying materiality
The consolidated social statement is a result of assessing legal requirements and 
disclosure commitments applicable to Novo Nordisk. Whether information is 
tied directly or indirectly to Novo Nordisk’s ability to create value over the short, 
medium and long term is also assessed. 
When assessing whether a disclosure is material to include in the consolidated 
social statement, Management considers whether the matter is of such relevance 
and importance that it could substantively influence the assessment by providers 
of financial capital of Novo Nordisk's ability to create value over the short, medium 
and long term. See more at novonordisk.com. 
The conclusion from the external assurance provider is available in the 
'Independent limited assurance report'.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated social statement and disclosures cover the Novo Nordisk Group 
comprising Novo Nordisk A/S and entities controlled by Novo Nordisk A/S.
Social accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below and in the notes have been applied consist-
ently in the preparation of the consolidated social statement for all the years 
presented.
Changes to accounting policies and disclosures
The following disclosure changes have been made:
•   'Patients reached with diabetes care products via the Access to Insulin 
Commitment' is expanded in scope to reflect new initiatives, effective as of 
2019. In addition to the least developed countries, the number now also covers 
patients reached in selected middle-income countries and through sales to 
selected organisations providing relief in humanitarian situations. The compara-
tive information has not been restated.
•   'Fulfilment of action points from the Novo Nordisk Way' is replaced with 
‘Facilitations of the Novo Nordisk Way’, to align with the new approach to 
assessing adherence to the Novo Nordisk Way.
•   'Company reputation' is replaced by 'Company trust' as a meaningful proxy for 
supportive stakeholder behaviours. The methodology has been adjusted and 
simplified.
Other accounting policies
Employee engagement
Employee engagement is measured on a scale of 1–5 and based on questions 
relating to employee engagement in the annual employee survey, OurVoice. The 
score is calculated as the proportion of employees who responded favourably (4 
or 5) to relevant questions. For 2019, the response rate was 90% compared with 
91% in 2018.

WDF, an independent trust, supports sustainable partnerships and acts as a catalyst 
to help others do more. In 2019, WDF provided funding to 12 partnership projects 
in 11 countries. The projects focus on awareness, education and capacity building 
at local, regional and global levels. See 'Note 5.2' in the consolidated financial 
statements and worlddiabetesfoundation.org.
Novo Nordisk also provides financial support for improving global access to 
haemophilia care. NNHF supports programmes in developing and emerging 
countries. Initiatives focus on capacity building, diagnosis and registry, education 
and empowerment. Since 2005, NNHF has provided funding for 284 programmes 
in 75 countries. See nnhf.org.
7.1 Patients reached with Novo Nordisk's 
diabetes care products (estimate)
7.3 Animals purchased for research
Accounting policies
The record of animals purchased for research comprises the number of animals 
purchased for all research undertaken by Novo Nordisk either in-house or by 
external contractors. The number of animals purchased is based on internal regis-
tration of purchased animals and yearly reports from external contractors.
Animals purchased
Number201920182017
Mice, rats and other rodents48,08163,54765,869

Dogs15710063
Non-human primates168278241
Other vertebrates24122
Total animals purchased49,63765,59367,623
The number of animals purchased for research in 2019 decreased by 24% 
compared with 2018 and reflects the changes in stages of the different research 
projects. Furthermore the reduction in the number of rodents purchased, reflects 
Novo Nordisk's continuous focus on reducing the number of animals per research 
project. 97% of the animals purchased were rodents.
Accounting policies
The number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's diabetes care prod-
ucts, excluding devices and PrandiMet
®
, is estimated by dividing Novo Nordisk’s 
annual sales volume by the annual usage dose per patient for each product class 
as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). PrandiMet
®
 is not included 
as no WHO-defined dosage exists. 
The number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's diabetes care prod-
ucts via the Access to Insulin Commitment is estimated by dividing Novo Nordisk's 
annual sales volume in the least developed countries as defined by the United 
Nations and 29 middle-income countries as defined by the World Bank as well as 
selected organisations providing relief in humanitarian situations, by the annual 
usage dose per patient for human insulin in vials as defined by WHO. WHO has 
not yet assigned a daily dose for Rybelsus
®
. For this calculation, it is assumed that 
one tablet equals one patient treatment day.
The WHO-defined daily dosage has not changed since 1982, except for Victoza
®
 
which was changed in 2019, and may not reflect the recommended or prescribed 
daily dose accurately. Actual doses are based on individual characteristics (e.g. age 
and weight) and pharmacokinetic considerations. Despite this uncertainty, Novo 
Nordisk assesses this to be the most consistent way of reporting.
Development
The estimated number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk’s diabetes 
care products increased from 29.2 million in 2018 to 30.0 million in 2019. This 
3% increase was primarily driven by sales of long-acting, premix and fast-acting 
insulins and GLP-1 products.
In 2019, the estimated number of patients reached via the Access to Insulin 
Commitment was 2.9 million, compared with 0.3 million in 2018. The significant 
increase is due to an expansion of the Access to Insulin Commitment to also 
include selected middle-income countries as well as selected organisations 
providing relief in humanitarian situations. Novo Nordisk sold insulin according 
to this commitment in 31 countries. Beyond this scheme, Novo Nordisk also sold 
human insulin below the ceiling price in other countries reaching an estimated 
additional 2.2 million patients in 2019.

8.2 Frequency of occupational accidents
Accounting policies
The frequency of occupational accidents with absence is measured as the inter-
nally reported number of accidents using full-time employees, excluding externals, 
employees on unpaid leave, interns, bachelor and master thesis employees, and 
substitutes, per million nominal working hours. An occupational accident with 
absence is any work-related accident causing at least one day of absence in addi-
tion to the day of the accident.
Development
The average frequency rate of occupational accidents with absence was 2.2 
per million working hours in 2019, compared with 2.4 in 2018 due to an 8% 
decrease in the number of accidents. In 2019, Novo Nordisk had one work-related 
fatality compared with none in 2018. Novo Nordisk works with a zero-injury 
mindset and has a long-term commitment to continuously improving safety 
performance.
8.1 Employees
Accounting policies
The number of employees is recorded as all employees except externals, 
employees on unpaid leave, interns, bachelor and master thesis employees and 
substitutes at year-end. 
Employees are attributed to geographical regions according to their primary 
workplace across the commercial units, research and development, production 
and support functions. Employees in corporate functions are included in Region 
Europe and employees in the global service centre in Bangalore, India are included 
in Region AAMEO (Africa, Asia, Middle-East and Oceania).
The rate of turnover is measured as the number of employees, excluding 
temporary employees, who left the Group during the financial year divided by 
the average number of employees, excluding temporary employees. Employees 
working for Group companies that have been disposed are not counted as having 
left the Group. 
Diversity at Novo Nordisk is reported as the percentage split by gender in all mana-
gerial positions. Managerial positions are defined as all managers at Novo Nordisk 
(global job level including Executive Vice Presidents (EVP), Senior Vice Presidents 
(SVP), Corporate Vice Presidents (CVP), Vice Presidents (VP), General Managers 
(GM), Directors, Managers and Team Leaders).

9.4 Supplier audits
Accounting policies
The number of supplier audits concluded by Novo Nordisk’s Corporate Quality 
function includes the number of responsible sourcing audits and quality audits 
conducted among suppliers.
Supplier audits
Number201920182017
Responsible sourcing audits271928
Quality audits209275218
Total supplier audits236294246
The number of audits concluded in 2019 decreased by 20% compared with 2018. 
The decrease in quality audits was due to the additional qualification audits in 
2018 supporting, among others, the diabetes API project in the US. There were no 
critical findings related to the quality audits, but one critical finding was issued in 
connection with a responsible sourcing audit regarding working hours. An action 
plan with concrete deadlines has been agreed upon and a responsible sourcing 
re-audit is planned for 2020 to follow up on improvements.
9.2 Business ethics reviews
Accounting policies
The number of business ethics reviews is recorded as the number of business 
ethics reviews performed by Group Internal Audit in subsidiaries, production sites 
and headquarter areas. During a business ethics review, Group Internal Audit will 
examine procedures and processes in place to ensure ethical behaviour. Any gaps 
identified in procedures, processes or behaviour are presented to Management 
and the Board of Directors as findings. An action plan to mitigate findings is 
agreed between Management and Group Internal Audit, and Group Internal 
Audit follows up on the implementation of the agreed actions before closing the 
findings. 
Business ethics reviews
Number201920182017
Business ethics reviews343334
Findings87113130
Based on the completed business ethics reviews, it is Group Internal Audit’s 
assessment that the business ethics compliance level, in 2019 as in 2018, is sound. 
Management action plans and closure of findings have progressed as planned, 
and there were no overdue management actions or findings at the end of the 
year.
Section 9
Responsible business
9.1 Relevant employees trained in business ethics 
Accounting policies
The mandatory business ethics training is based on the Business Ethics Code of 
Conduct in the form of globally applicable e-learning, and related tests released 
annually by the Novo Nordisk Business Ethics Compliance Office. The target 
groups for the individual tests vary in size and are defined by Novo Nordisk. The 
target groups are all employees of Novo Nordisk at the end of the reporting 
period except employees on leave, student assistants, PhDs and postdocs. The 
percentage of employees completing the training is calculated as the percentage 
of completion of training in both the Code of Conduct and related tests, based on 
internal registrations.
Development
In 2019, as in 2018, 99% of relevant employees were trained in business ethics.
9.3 Facilitations of the Novo Nordisk Way
Accounting policies
Facilitations of the Novo Nordisk Way is measured as the number of facilitations 
and culture coachings completed. Both are internal audit processes for assessing 
compliance with the Novo Nordisk Way. The assessments are based on review of 
documentation and feedback from stakeholders followed by an on-site visit during 
which randomly selected employees and management are interviewed. Identified 
gaps and improvement opportunities related to the Novo Nordisk Way are 
presented to management. The facilitators and management agree on an action 
plan to address those gaps and improvement opportunities.
In Q4 2018, culture coaching was introduced as a variation of the facilitation 
service to support the company-wide culture journey focused on ‘think bigger’, 
‘cut complexity’ and ‘be more agile’. Culture coaching builds on the same meth-
odology as standard facilitations and is also anchored in the Novo Nordisk Way. In 
the information below, no distinction is made between a standard facilitation and 
culture coaching - both are referred to under the term 'facilitations'.
Development
In 2019, a total of 32 units were facilitated covering approximately 11,000 
employees, of whom around 1,500 were individually interviewed. In addition, 
feedback on those units was collected from approximately 400 stakeholders. The 
reduction in the number of assignments compared to previous years is mainly a 
result of merging assignments to cover entire functional areas instead of facili-
tating many departments individually.
Overall, the 2019 process has shown a high level of adherence to the Novo 
Nordisk Way. The highest rated Essential continues to be the 'Patient-centred busi-
ness approach', while the lowest rated Essential 'Focus on personal performance 
and development' continues to be an area of improvement despite efforts to raise 
the level of adherence.

9.8 Total tax contribution
Accounting policies
Novo Nordisk’s total tax contribution is measured as the taxes borne or collected 
by Novo Nordisk, which have been paid in the respective year. Taxes borne are 
defined as taxes where Novo Nordisk carries the cost. Taxes collected are defined 
as taxes collected by Novo Nordisk on behalf of others, e.g. employee income 
taxes deducted from the employee salary and paid on to the government.
Tax on company income
Tax on company income primarily consists of corporate income taxes and with-
holding taxes on company dividends. 
Employment taxes
Employment taxes primarily consist of taxes collected from the employees on 
behalf of the government and social security costs.
Indirect taxes
Indirect taxes consist of non-refundable VAT, net VAT collections, customs duties, 
environmental taxes and property taxes.
Other taxes
Other taxes consist of country-specific taxes not linked to one of the categories 
above, e.g. the US branded prescription drug (BPD) fee. 
The total tax contribution in 2019 amounted to DKK 27,527 million split into 54% 
on taxes borne and 46% on taxes collected compared with 2018, where the total 
tax contribution was DKK 25,825 million split into 53% on taxes borne and 47% 
on taxes collected.

9.7 Company trust
Accounting policies
Company trust is measured annually. The total score is measured as the mean 
company trust score among people with diabetes, general practitioners and 
diabetes specialists across key markets. Trust is measured on a scale of 0–100, 
with 100 being the best possible score. A score above 80 is considered excellent; a 
score between 70 and 80 is considered strong. Data were collected between June 
and September 2019.
The data are collected through annual surveys carried out by external consultancy 
firms.

General practitioners75.385.778.5
Diabetes specialists81.389.286.0
Total score (average)78.284.582.2
The decline in trust can best be explained by the increased scrutiny on pharma 
throughout 2019, in particular in regards to pricing, access and affordability of 
medicines, which continues to be reflected in media sentiment and social media 
conversations. The decline in trust is not unique to Novo Nordisk, but is a trend 
across the pharma sector.
9.6 Failed inspections
Accounting policies
The number of failed inspections is measured in relation to the US Food & Drug 
Administration (USFDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Notified Body 
(TÜV SUD) and domestic authorities for strategic manufacturing sites. Failed 
inspections are defined as inspections where Warning Letters or EMA non-com-
pliance letters related to GMP inspections are received, GMP/ISO certificates for 
strategic sites are lost, pre-approval inspections result in a Warning Letter, study 
conclusions are changed due to GCP/GLP inspection issues, or marketing or import 
authorisations are withdrawn due to inspection issues. Strategic sites are defined 
as the manufacturing sites in Brazil, China, Denmark, France and the US.
Development
In 2019, as in 2018, there were no failed inspections among those resolved at 
year-end. During the year, 66 inspections were conducted compared with 75 in 
2018. At year-end, 44 inspections were passed and 22 were unresolved, as final 
inspection reports had not been received or the final authority acceptance was 
pending, which is normal. Follow-up on unresolved inspections continues in 2020.
9.5 Product recalls
Accounting policies
The number of product recalls is recorded as the number of times Novo Nordisk 
has instituted a recall and includes recalls in connection with clinical trials. A recall 
can affect various countries.
Development
Novo Nordisk had four product recalls from the market in 2019, compared with 
three in 2018. As in 2018, none of the recalls were critical. Local health authorities 
were informed in all instances to ensure that distributors, pharmacies, doctors and 
patients received appropriate information.

Basis of preparation’ of the consolidated social statement for general overview. In 
addition, the following standards have been applied:
•   Recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). TCFD aims to develop voluntary, consistent 
climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies in providing 
information to investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders. Novo 
Nordisk’s actions taken in line with the TCFD recommendations are reported at 
novonordisk.com.
•   CDP (formerly Climate Disclosure Project). CDP runs a global environmental 
disclosure system, which supports companies with measuring and managing 
risks and opportunities related to climate change, water security and deforesta-
tion. Novo Nordisk's CDP disclosures are publicly available at cdp.net
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated environmental statement covers the production sites, laborato-
ries and offices with significant activities. CO

Section 11
Resources
11.1 Energy consumption for operations and share  
of renewable power
Accounting policies
Energy consumption for operations is measured as consumption of power, steam, 
heat and fuel. The fuel is mainly from natural gas, biogas and wood. Energy 
consumption is based on meter readings and invoices and covers all energy types 
at production sites and laboratories and consumption of power at office buildings 
outside of production sites. 
Share of renewable power used at production sites is reported according to the 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Scope 2 Guideline. It is calculated as the sum of 
power in each country that comes from 100% renewable sources, either sourced 
or self-produced.

Section 12 
Emissions and waste
11.2 Water consumption for production sites 
Accounting policies
Water consumption is measured based on meter readings and invoices. It includes 
drinking water, industrial water and steam used at production sites.
Development
In 2019, water consumption at production sites increased slightly by 2% 
compared with 2018. This was due to an increase in water consumption for 
production of API for Diabetes and Obesity care.
Three facilities, in Algeria, Brazil and China, are in regions subject to high water 
stress or large seasonal variations, consuming 14% of the total water for global 
production. There have been no water shortage incidents in 2019 and overall, 
water consumption at these facilities increased by 2% in 2019.

Novo Nordisk has a long-term target of zero CO
2 
emissions from operations and 
transportation by 2030. 
In 2019, CO
2
 emissions from operations and transportation increased by 10%.  
The increase was primarily from product distribution, due to an increase in 
distributed volume, along with using more air freight than sea freight as a result of 
supply and market driven-challenges. 
CO
2 
emissions from global offices and laboratories decreased by 54% in 2019. As 
part of the new Circular for Zero strategy, all offices and laboratories will source 
renewable power by 2030. In 2019, there was a significant reduction in CO
2
 
emissions from the R&D site in Beijing, sourcing wind power.
CO
2
 emissions are expected to decrease significantly in 2020 due to various 
renewable energy projects, including solar power across all US operations, wind 
power in Europe and green steam in Denmark. Emissions from transportation are 
also expected to decrease due to a company car policy that encourages transition 
to hybrid and electric vehicles and through collaboration with EV100.
A full breakdown of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from Novo Nordisk can be found 
at cdp.net.
reduced energy use to produce diabetes finished products. Energy consumption 
decreased by 10% from offices and laboratories due to various smaller changes 
across multiple sites.
In 2019, 76% of power used at production sites was sourced from renewable 
energy, a decrease from 77% in 2018. This is due to lower power consumption at 
the largest production site in Kalundborg, Denmark which uses wind power. With 
an agreement to have solar power in the United States, effective as of 2020, Novo 
Nordisk is on track to achieve 100% renewable power at all production sites in 2020.

12.2 Waste from production sites
Accounting policies
Waste is measured as the sum of all the waste disposed of at production sites 
based on weight receipts.

Total waste124142157
1.   Organic residues for recycling are waste from the production of the active pharmaceutical 
ingredients, where the energy is recovered in biogas plants and the digested slurry is used 
on local farmland as fertiliser.
2.   Energy recovery is waste disposed of at waste-to-energy plants and at a biogas plant.
3.   Ethanol is used in purification of Diabetes care and Biopharm products. The ethanol is 
recovered in internal regeneration plants and re-used many times. The ethanol waste 
reported here is from production with no regeneration or residues from the regeneration 
process.
4.   Water waste and other waste not suitable for other disposal methods, such as hazardous 
waste for incineration and various other types of waste.
In 2019, waste from production sites decreased by 13% compared with 2018. 
The amount of waste recycled decreased 8% in 2019 primarily due to a decrease 
in organic residues from the fermentation of insulin. 
The amount of waste sent for energy recovery decreased by 36% primarily due 
to the implementation of a distillation method within API production to reuse 
ethanol instead of sending it for incineration with energy recovery.
In 2019, 93% of the total waste from production sites was recycled, used for 
biogas production or incinerated at plants where the energy is used for heat and 
power production. 
18% of the waste is categorised as hazardous waste, a decrease from 21% in 
2018. This decrease was due to a reduction in ethanol waste from the production 
of API for Diabetes and Obesity care.
Section 13
Responsible business
13.1 Breaches of regulatory limit values
Accounting policies
Breaches of regulatory limit values cover all breaches reported to the environ-
mental authorities.
Development
In 2019 there were 16 breaches, a decrease from 27 breaches in 2018. The 
breaches were mainly related to wastewater, and all had minor impact on the 
environment.

Statement by the board of directors and
executive management on the annual report
Today, the Board of Directors and Executive Management approved the Annual 
Report of Novo Nordisk A/S for the year 2019. The Board of Directors and Execu-
tive Management are jointly responsible for ensuring the integrity and quality of 
the report.
The Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with the International Inte-
grated Reporting Framework.

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board and in accordance with IFRS as endorsed by the EU 
and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Further, the Financial statements of the parent company and Management’s 
review have been prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements 
Act.
In our opinion, the Consolidated financial statements and the Financial statements 
of the parent company give a true and fair view of the financial position at 31 
December 2019, the results of the Group’s and parent company’s operations, and 
consolidated cash flows for the financial year 2019. Furthermore, in our opinion, 
Management's review includes a true and fair account of the development in 
the operations and financial circumstances, of the results for the year and of the 
financial position of the Group and the parent company as well as a description 
of the most significant risks and elements of uncertainty facing the Group and the 
parent company.
Novo Nordisk’s Consolidated social and environmental statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the reporting principles of materiality, inclusivity and 
responsiveness of AA1000APS(2018), and social and environmental accounting

87Consolidated Financial Statements – Management statement

Independent auditor's report
To the shareholders of Novo Nordisk A/S
Our opinion
In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and fair view 
of the Group’s financial position at 31 December 2019 and of the results of the 
Group’s operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 
2019 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Moreover, in our opinion, the Parent Company Financial Statements give a true 
and fair view of the Parent Company’s financial position at 31 December 2019 and 
of the results of the Parent Company’s operations for the financial year 1 January 
to 31 December 2019 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Our opinion is consistent with our Auditor’s Long-form Report to the Audit 
Committee and the Board of Directors.
What we have audited
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Novo Nordisk A/S for the financial year 
1 January to 31 December 2019, section ‘Consolidated financial statements’, 
comprise income statement and statement of comprehensive income, cash flow 
statement, balance sheet, equity statement and notes, including summary of 
significant accounting policies.
The Parent Company Financial Statements of Novo Nordisk A/S for the financial 
year 1 January to 31 December 2019, section ‘Financial Statements of the Parent 
Company’, comprise income statement, balance sheet, equity statement and 
notes, including summary of significant accounting policies.
Collectively referred to as the “Financial Statements”.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
(ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities 
under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants 
(IESBA Code) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. We have 
also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code.  
To the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services referred to 
in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 were not provided. 
Appointment
We were first appointed auditors of Novo Nordisk A/S in April 1982 for the financial 
year 1982. We have been reappointed annually by shareholder resolution for a total 
period of uninterrupted engagement of 38 years including the financial year 2019.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of 
most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements for 2019. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
Key audit matterHow our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition relating to rebates and discounts in the US business
The Group sells to various customers in the US, which can fall under certain 
commercial and government mandated contracts and reimbursement arrange-
ments, of which the most significant are Managed Care, Medicare, Medicaid and 
charge-backs to wholesalers.
These arrangements result in deductions to gross sales in arriving at net sales and 
give rise to obligations for the Group to provide customers with rebates, discounts 
and allowances, which for unsettled amounts are recognised as an accrual.
We focused on this area because rebates, discounts and allowances are complex 
and because establishing an appropriate accrual requires significant judgement 
and estimation by Management. This judgement is particularly complex in a 
US healthcare environment in which competitive pricing pressure and product 
discounting are growing trends. 
Refer to note 2.1 and note 3.7.
We obtained Management’s calculations for accruals under applicable schemes 
and assessed the significance of assumptions applied by comparing them to the 
stated commercial policies, the terms of the applicable contracts, third party data 
and historical levels of paid rebates and discounts in the US business.
We compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical rebates, discounts, 
allowances and to current payment trends. We also considered the historical 
accuracy of the Group’s estimates in previous years. 
We formed an independent assessment of the most significant elements of the 
accrual at 31 December 2019 using third party data and compared this expecta-
tion to the actual accrual recognised.
Litigations
The pharmaceuticals industry is heavily regulated which increases inherent litiga-
tion risk and litigation and contingent liabilities may arise from product-specific 
and general legal proceedings, from guarantees, marketing practices, unethical 
behaviour or government investigations connected with the Group’s activities.
We focused on this area as the amounts involved are potentially material and 
the valuation of the provision is based on application of material judgement and 
estimation and therefore is associated with uncertainty. Accordingly, unexpected 
adverse outcomes could significantly impact the Group’s reported profit and 
financial position. 
Refer to note 3.7.
We discussed the status of significant known actual and potential litigations with 
in-house legal counsel. We have obtained and substantively tested evidence to 
support the decisions and rationale for provisions held or decisions not to recog-
nise provisions, including correspondence with external legal counsel and other 
counter-parties and considered Management’s assessment of the probability of 
defending any litigation and the reliability of estimating any provisions.
We assessed litigation history and other available evidence to assess the valuation 
and completeness of the provisions recognised by the Group. We have obtained 
confirmations from external legal counsel to confirm our understanding of 
settled and outstanding litigation and asserted claims. We evaluated significant 
adjustments to legal provisions recorded during the year to determine if they were 
indicative of management bias.
We tested the completeness of the external legal counsels from whom we have 
asked for direct confirmation by testing legal expenses on a sample basis and 
comparing to internal documents.

88Independent auditor’s report

Statement on Management’s Review
Management is responsible for Management’s Review, section ‘Managements 
review’.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover Management’s Review, 
and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to 
read Management’s Review and, in doing so, consider whether Management’s 
Review is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
Moreover, we considered whether Management’s Review includes the disclosures 
required by the Danish Financial Statements Act. 
Based on the work we have performed, in our view, Management’s Review is in 
accordance with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company 
Financial Statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstate-
ment in Management’s Review.
Management’s responsibilities for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial state-
ments that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish 
Financial Statements Act and for the preparation of parent company financial 
statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial 
Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is neces-
sary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing 
the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the 
Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alterna-
tive but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial 
Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in 
Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements appli-
cable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
•   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit proce-
dures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrep-
resentations, or the override of internal control.
•   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and 
the Parent Company’s internal control.
•   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonable-
ness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.
•   Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in 
the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Group or the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial 
Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
•   Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information 
of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on 
the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible 
for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other 
matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our 
audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reason-
ably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we deter-
mine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial 
Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.

89Independent auditor’s report

Independent limited assurance report on the consolidated  
social and environmental statements for 2019
To the Stakeholders of Novo Nordisk A/S
Novo Nordisk A/S engaged us to provide limited assurance on the information 
described below and set out in the Annual Report of Novo Nordisk for the year 
ended 31 December 2019.
Our conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained:
A) Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
Consolidated social and environmental statements of Novo Nordisk’s Annual 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2019 has not been prepared, in all mate-
rial respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
B) Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the descrip-
tion of Novo Nordisk’s alignment with the AA1000 Accountability Principles 
(AA1000AP) (2018) of Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Impact is not 
fairly stated.
This conclusion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of our 
report.
What we are assuring
The scope of our work was limited to assurance over:
A) The 'Consolidated social statement' and 'The consolidated environmental 
statement' and associated 'Notes‘, in the Annual Report of Novo Nordisk (the 
“Selected Information”).
B) Novo Nordisk’s description of alignment with the AA1000AP principles of 
Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Impact for the year ended 31 December 
2019 which is set out in ‘Basis of preparation‘ in section ‘Consolidated social 
statement‘ (the “Stakeholder Engagement description”) of the Annual Report.
Professional standards applied and level of assurance
We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) ‘Assurance Engagements 
other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ and AA1000 
Assurance Standard (AA1000AS, 2008) with 2018 Addendum (Type 2, moderate, 
which is the equivalent to ISAE 3000 limited assurance). A limited assurance 
engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engage-
ment in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an under-
standing of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the 
assessed risks; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been 
obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
Our independence and quality control
We have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued 
by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which includes 
independence and other ethical requirements founded on fundamental principles 
of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality 
and professional behaviour. We also qualify as independent as defined by the 
AA1000 Assurance Standard (AA1000AS, 2008) with 2018 Addendum. The firm 
applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains 
a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and 
procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards 
and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an 
independent multidisciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and 
assurance.
Understanding reporting and measurement methodologies
The Selected Information needs to be read and understood together with the 
Reporting Criteria, sections ‘Consolidated social statement‘ and ‘Consolidated 
environmental statement‘, which Novo Nordisk A/S is solely responsible for 
selecting and applying. The absence of a significant body of established practice 
on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for 
different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities and over time.
Work performed
A) We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of 
material misstatement of the Selected Information. In doing so, we:
•   Conducted interviews with data owners to understand the key processes and 
control activities for reporting site performance data.
•   Obtained an understanding of the key processes and controls for managing, 
recording and reporting the Selected Information.
•   Performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Selected 
Information at corporate head office to check that data had been appropriately 
measured, recorded, collated and reported.
•   Performed analysis of data from reporting sites, selected on the basis of risk and 
materiality to the group; and
• Considered the presentation and disclosure of the Selected Information.
B) In respect of Novo Nordisk’s description of alignment with the AA1000 
Accountability Principles (AA1000AP) (2018) of Inclusivity, Materiality, 
Responsiveness and Impact we performed the following activities:
•   Interviewed members of Novo Nordisk’s Executive Management team, repre-
sentatives responsible for GLP-1 portfolio and market access at global level 
and in the US, key employees within Corporate Global Patient Access and 
Corporate Sustainability to determine their understanding of their stakeholders, 
the mechanisms used to engage them and key issues that are of interest to 
each stakeholder group.
•   Interviewed external stakeholders to determine their perception of Novo 
Nordisk’s capabilities in relation to stakeholder engagement, in particular, in 
relation to understanding and responding to material patient concerns, needs 
and desires.
•   Reviewed evidence on a selective basis to support the assertions made in these 
interviews and in the Stakeholder Engagement description.
•   Confirmed the existence of systems and procedures to support Novo Nordisk’s 
governance for responsible business conduct and stakeholder relationships. 
Our work focused on priorities and responsible decision-making relating to the 
development, launch and rollout of oral semaglutide and how this aligns with 
Novo Nordisk’s ambition of creating a sustainable business; and
•   Assessed the disclosure and presentation of the Stakeholder Engagement 
description.
Novo Nordisk’s responsibilities
Novo Nordisk’s management are responsible for:
•   Designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls over information 
relevant to the preparation of the Selected Information that is free from mate-
rial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 
• Establishing objective Reporting Criteria for preparing the Selected Information;
•   Measuring and reporting the Selected Information based on the Reporting 
Criteria; and
• Reporting the Stakeholder Engagement description; and 
• The content of the Annual Report 2019.
Our responsibility
We are responsible for:
•   Planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about 
whether the Selected Information and the Stakeholder Engagement description 
is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 
•   Forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have 
performed and the evidence we have obtained; and 
• Reporting our conclusion to the Stakeholders of Novo Nordisk A/S.
Observations and recommendations
According to AA1000AS with 2018 addendum, we are required to include 
observations and recommendations for improvements in relation to adherence to 
the AA1000APS principles. We have no significant recommendations regarding 
Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Impact. We have communicated a 
number of minor recommendations for improvement to the management of Novo 
Nordisk.

94Financial Statements of the Parent Company

Notes
1 Accounting policies
The financial statements of the parent company have been prepared in accord-
ance with the Danish Financial Statements Act (Class D) and other accounting 
regulations for companies listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen. 
The accounting policies for the financial statements of the parent company are 
unchanged from the previous financial year except for a change of accounting 
policy for leases and changed presentation of the balance sheet. The accounting 
policies are the same as for the consolidated financial statements with the adjust-
ments described below. For a description of the accounting policies of the group, 
please refer to the consolidated financial statements.
No separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for the parent company; 
please refer to the statement of cash flows for the group.
Change of presentation of balance sheet
The parent company has changed the presentation of the balance sheet to align 
to the balance sheet for the Group. Deferred tax asset is now being presented as 
a non-current asset and provisions are now being presented as non-current and 
current liabilities. The change had no impact on recognised amounts.
Change of accounting policy for leasing
As of 1 January 2019, the parent company has changed accounting policy for 
leases from using IAS 17 for interpretation of the Danish Financial Statements Act 
to using IFRS 16. The parent company implemented IFRS 15 as interpretation for 
revenue in the financial statements for 2018. 
The change has been applied by using the modified retrospective approach. 
Under this method, the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is 
recognised at 1 January 2019. Rights-of-use assets and lease liabilities have been 
recognised for those leases previously classified as operating leases, except for 
short-term leases and leases of low value assets. The rights-of-use assets have 
been recognised based on the amount equal to the lease liabilities, adjusted for 
any related prepaid and accrued lease payments previously recognised. Lease 
liabilities are recognised based on the present value of the remaining lease 
payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as of 1 January 
2019. The comparative information has not been restated. The weighted average 
incremental borrowing rate applied on transition to IFRS 16 for parent company 
was 1.20%.
For a description of the transition method used and for a description of the 
new accounting policies please refer to note 1.2 in the consolidated financial 
statements.
The impact of the change in accounting policy is recognition of additional 
DKK 1,010 million of property, plant and equipment and DKK 1,010 million of 
borrowings. The change in policy has had an insignificant impact on the income 
statement for 2019.

Financial assets
In the financial statements of the parent company, investments in subsidiaries and 
associated companies are recorded under the equity method, using the respective 
share of the net asset values in subsidiaries and associated companies. Net profit 
of subsidiaries and associated company less unrealised intra-group profits is 
recorded in the income statement of the parent companies.
To the extent that net profit exceeds declared dividends from such companies, 
net revaluation of investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are trans-
ferred to Net revaluation reserve under equity according to the equity method. 
Profits in subsidiaries and associated companies are disclosed as profit after tax.
Ta x
For Danish tax purposes, the parent company is assessed jointly with its Danish 
subsidiaries. The Danish jointly taxed companies are included in a Danish on-ac-
count tax payment scheme for Danish corporate income tax. All current taxes 
under the scheme are recorded in the individual companies. Novo Nordisk A/S and 
its Danish subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation of the parent company, 
Novo Holdings A/S.
Uncertain tax positions are presented individually as part of Tax receivables/Tax 
payables. 
Novo Nordisk recognises deferred income tax assets, if it is probable that sufficient 
taxable income will be available in the future, against which the temporary differ-
ences can be utilised.
